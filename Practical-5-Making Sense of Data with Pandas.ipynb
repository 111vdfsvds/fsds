    "# Making Sense of Data with Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas stands for 'Python Data Analysis Library'; it is designed to provide data scientists working in Python with a set of powerful tools to load, transform, and process large-ish data sets. As a result, it has become something of a *de facto* standard for online tutorials and many of the lessons that you can find online will make use of pandas at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will want to bookmark [the documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) since you will undoubtedly need to refer to it fairly regularly. _Note_: this link is to the most recent, stable release. If you are using an older version of pandas then you'll need to track down the appropriate version from the [home page](http://pandas.pydata.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can always check what version you have installed like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "print pd.__version__\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Note*: this approach won't necessarily work with _every_ package, but it will work with many of them. Remember that variables and methods starting and ending with '`__`' are **private** and any interaction with them should be approached very, very carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, the main elements of pandas with which you interact directly are: \n",
    "1. the DataFrame; \n",
    "2. the Series;\n",
    "3. the Index. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look:"

    "On second thought, let's never do that again. Well, at least not _that_ way! You'll have noticed that the help documentation for the DataFrame is not just a bit longer than anything we've seen before, it's massively longer. There's probably quite a lot of intimidating terminology in there too... Right from the start we get things like \"Two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the thing: in the [last notebook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kingsgeocomp/geocomputation/master/Practical-4-Functions%2C%20Packages%20and%20Methods.ipynb) we came close to inventing something a lot like pandas from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "So you already _know_ what's going on, or at least have an analogy that you can use to make sense of it. Pandas takes a column-view of data in the same way that our Dictionary-of-Lists did, it's just got a lot more features. That's why the documentation is so much more forbidding and why pandas is so much more powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "But at its heart, a pandas data frame ('df' for short) is just a collection of data series (i.e. columns) with an index. Each Series is like one of our column-lists from the last notebook. And the df is like the overarching dictionary that held the collection of data series (serieses?) together. OK? You've seen this before.\n",

    "The UK's Met Office is a world-leading weather and climate research centre, and even if it doesn't always seem like their forecasts are very accurate that's because Britain's weather is inherently _unpredictable_. They've also done a lot of work to make their weather data widely available to people like us.\n",
    "\n",
    "I probably don't need to say a _lot_ about weather data because you've probably been making use of forecasts for much of your life! But it's _still_ worth understanding something about how weather data is gathered and reported: many organisations operate weather stations where data on wind speed, temperature, rain, and amount of sun are collected and then transmitted to a server to be integrated into a larger data set of weather _observations_ at a national or global scale. Of course, any _one_ station might be in the 'wrong' place (somewhere shady or protected from the rain) or it might even break down, but the idea is that if you have enough of them you can collect a pretty good range of data for the country and begin to look for patterns and, potentially, make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be access data from the MetOffice from a couple of different locations where observations such as the ones below are collected:\n",
    "* <Param name=\"F\" units=\"C\">Feels Like Temperature (units: degrees Celsius)\n",
    "* <Param name=\"G\" units=\"mph\">Wind Gust (units: mph)</Param>\n",
    "* <Param name=\"H\" units=\"%\">Screen Relative Humidity (units: percent)</Param> \n",
    "* <Param name=\"T\" units=\"C\">Temperature (units: degrees Celsius)</Param> \n",
    "* <Param name=\"V\" units=\"\">Visibility (units: km?)</Param> \n",
    "* <Param name=\"D\" units=\"compass\">Wind Direction (units: compass degrees)</Param>  \n",
    "* <Param name=\"S\" units=\"mph\">Wind Speed (units: mph)</Param> \n",
    "* <Param name=\"U\" units=\"\">Max UV Index (units: index value)</Param> \n",
    "* <Param name=\"W\" units=\"\">Weather Type (units: categorical)</Param> \n",
    "* <Param name=\"Pp\" units=\"%\">Precipitation Probability (units: percent)</Param>\n",
    "\n",
    "These observations are only associated with a particular station (where did we see/will we see these values?), they will also be associated with _either_ a particular time in the past (when were they collected?) or, if they're forecasts, with a particular time in the future (when do we expect to see them?). \n",
    "\n",
    "So although weather data might seem more 'objective' than data on social class (though for obvious reasons it turns out that both are just attempts to capture data about reality, not reality itself), it may also turn out to be very complex to store and manage beccause of the temporal element _and_ the fact that it's not just a count of one thing, each of these observations uses a very different set of units.\n",

When you have data that is always changing from minute to minute or day to day then you use an API (Application Programming Interface) to access it: the API knows that \"yesterday's weather\" means \"work out what day it is right now and then get the weather from the day before\", and it also knows that \"give me the current weather from station X\" means \"look up station X and find the latest weather report that I've received\". In other words, an API is  designed with programmatic, dynamic interaction in mind right from the start.\n",

    "And if we have to add checks on each one of these `keys` to see if it is a list, a dictionary, or a simple float/int then this code would explode in complexity and become very, very hard to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is another way. It's a concept called _recursion_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine that we have to deal with lists-of-lists (because those are a bit simpler to think about) but we don't know in advance how many lists there are inside of each list; e.g.:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    ['Value 2'],\n",
    "    'Value 3'\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "What a nightmare! That's hard to even _read_, let alone know how to process! But recursion allows us reframe this problem as something that is _almost_ simple (it's certainly elegant): we need a function that steps through a list one element at a time and then: \n",
    "* if the element is a simple value (float, int or string) then it prints it out, \n",

You'll also notice that every time we recurse (call `outputList` or `outputDict` _again_) that we increment (increase) depth by 1. So this helps us to make the formatting legible so that we can see where each embedded list or dictionary actually sits within the data.\n",

    "It's probably better that we just see hi it action... In our case we know that we're starting with a dictionary so we would ask `outputDict` to start outputting the content of `pdesc` (the rePly DESCription). `outputDict` then takes each of the key/value pairs in turn, looks at the value to see if _it_ is a dictionary or list or (by default) string and takes appropriate action. Don't get too stressed out if it doesn't make sense just yet, but it's such a powerful concept that it's definitely worth getting to grips with it."

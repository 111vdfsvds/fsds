[^index-1]: The Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis

# Welcome {.unnumbered}

<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/"><img src="img/casa_logo.jpg" alt="CASA0013 course" width="120" align="right" style="margin: 0 1em 0 1em"/></a>

The *Foundations of Spatial Data Science* (FSDS) module is part of CASA's [MSc degree offering](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/programmes) builds on a step-change in our ability to work with large spatial data sets. The design of the module is informed by the dearth of planners and geographers able to *think* computationally using programming, data analysis, and data manipulation skills. There is a severe skills shortage in this domain across all sectors: non-profit, government, corporate, and academic.

The module's objective is to enable students to access, understand, utilise, visualise and communicate data in a spatial context. FSDS is *not* about pushing buttons, but about using logic, programming, and analytical skills to tackle complex real-world problems in a creative, reproducible, and open manner.

## To Dos

- [Shift away from .values](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17241004/how-do-
i-convert-a-pandas-series-or-index-to-a-numpy-array/54324513#54324513)
- Swap Weeks 8 (Visualising Data) and 9 (Dimensions in Data) + explain rationale
 to students.
- Shift focus of (new) Week 9 & 10 to review/discussing the final assessment. Co
ntent still available to view/practice but not required/delivered.
- Require more active use of GitHub/Git — a submission in which it’s easy to aut
omate checks that they’ve created a repo and populated it with the completed not
ebooks?
- Refresh Code Camp and make it more self-test oriented. Use the self-test to se
t expectations about level of effort/preparation required (and whether or not ta
king the module will be useful).
- Standardise delivery of practical content by TAs: should have consistent appro
ach across practicals.
- Point to cross-module content/recaps.
- Joint reading list?
- Investigate [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/software/python) as an alternative. Wh
at is situation with JupyterHub at UCL.

## Acknowledgements

While this module in indebted to both feedback from students and colleagues over the years, several people played a particularly outsize role in my thinking and deserve special acknowledgement:

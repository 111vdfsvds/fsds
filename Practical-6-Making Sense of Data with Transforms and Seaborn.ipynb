    "# Making Sense of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week we did some basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) with the MetOffice weather data, but it was limited to mainly looking at a few graphs right at the end of the practical. Thanks to that, depending on the data you got you may spotted a 'problem' or two (_e.g._ temperature readings at the start or end of the time series that were basically 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we want to tackle this in a more systematic way. We are going to switch data sets because the Socio-Economic data is easier to manipulate than the weather data and it has a few features that are particularly useful for demonstrating the value of transformation and standardisation."

    "## Introduction: all models are wrong, but some are useful\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistician George Box [once said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong) \"all models are wrong but some are useful\". Now you might think that 'wrong' _necessarily implies_ uselessness, but this aphorism should tell you that things are a lot more interesting than that: let's review the idea of statistics as the study of a '[data-generating process](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9639.2012.00524.x/full)'. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data that we work with is a _representation_ of reality, it is not reality itself. Just because I can say that the height of human beings is normally distributed with a mean of, say, 170cm and standard deviation of 8cm doesn't mean that I've _explained_ that process. What I have done is to say that reality can be reasonably well approximated by a data-generating process that uses the normal distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that understanding of height distributions, I know that someone with a heigh of 2m is very, very improbable. Not impossible, just highly unlikely. So if I meet someone that tall then that's quite exciting! But my use of a normal distribution to represent the empirical reality of human height doesn't mean that I think it is _actually_ distributed randomly amongst all human beings in a gigantic lottery system: some parts of the world are typically shorter, other parts typically taller; some families are typically shorter, while others are typically taller...\n",
    "\n",
    "So the _real_ reason for someone's height is to do with, I assume, a mix of genetics and nutrition. However, across large groups of people it's possible to _represent_ the cumulative impact of those individual realities with a simple normal distribution. And using that simplified data-generating process allows me to do things like estimate the likelihood of meeting someone more than 2m tall (which is why I'd be excited to do so, though not as excited as the guy in the next video...).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a (genuinely terrifying) video that tries to explain this whole idea in a different way:\n",
    "\n",
    "[![From reality to make-believe](http://img.youtube.com/vi/HAfI0g_S9oo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAfI0g_S9oo)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way, real individuals earn different incomes for all sorts of reasons: skills, education, negotiation ability... and, of course, systematic discrimination or bias. Because of wide variations in individual lived experience, it's quite hard to _prove_ that any _one_ person has been discriminated against unless you have the 'smoking gun' of an email or other direct evidence that this has happened. \n",
    "\n",
    "But if I have data on _many_ men and women (from a company, industry, or society) to work with, then I can take a look at what data-generting processes best describe what I've observed. And I can also create a data generating process that would describe what I'd _expect_ to see if no systematic discrimination were taking place at all. I make that sound simple but, of course, it's really hard to do this properly: do you account for the fact that discrimination has probably happened throughout someone's lifetime, not just in their most recent job? And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, when we have created a data-generating process that captures this at what we feel is an appropriate level, then the analytical process becomes about testing to see if there is a _significant_ difference between what I expected and what I observed. Once we've done that, then we can start to rule out claims that 'there are no good candidates' and the other defences of the indefensible. It is always theoretically _possible_ that a company had trouble finding qualified candidates, but as you put together the evidence from your model it may well  become increasingly _improbable_.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, always remember that, while the data is not reality, it _is_ a very useful abstraction of reality that allows us to make certain claims about what we expected to see. Linking our observations to what we know about the characteristics of the data generating process then allows us to look at the _significance_ of our results or to search for outliers in the data that seem highly improbable and, consequently, worth further investigation."

    "## Socio-economic Classification Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Many governments publish large data sets drawn from a national Census that takes place every 5 or 10 years. And we know that things like education and income affect people's life chances in the long-run: higher levels of education, higher incomes, more senior jobs, and owning a house (instead of renting) tend to be linked to better health and other long-term advantages. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if we want to understand the distribution of these advantages in the population as a whole it might be handy to derive a 'class' for every household based on their levels of education, their job, their, health, and so forth. We're not saying that these 'classes' are objective realities since you could clearly slice and dice income, profession, and so on in a nearly infinite number of ways; but we can look in the data for 'natural breaks' or other meanignful thresholds (given our assumptions about the 'data generating process'). \n",

    "| 7 | Routine occupations |\n",
    "| 8 | Never worked or long-term unemployed |\n",

But wouldn't it be even _more_ interesting to be able to look at how tall students are _relative_ to the mean? Is there someone from the basketball team taking this course? Or maybe the cox from a crew? How could we make it easy to compare the difference between each student and the overall class average in order to spot these 'special cases'?\n",

    "2. If a student is taller _than average_ then their transformed height is more than 0\n",

    "### Using the Z-Score\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start to bring the idea of the 'data generating processes' to life. The first thing to do with the z-score is to look at what it implies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Subtracting the mean implies that the mean _is a useful measure of centrality_: in other words, the only reason to subtract the mean is if the mean is _meaningful_. If you are dealing with highly skewed data then the mean is not going to be very useful and, by implication, neither is the z-score.\n",
    "2. Dividing by the Standard Deviation implies that this _is a useful measure of distribution_: again, if the data is heavily skewed or follows some exponential distribution then the standard deviation is not going to very useful as an analytical tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the z-score is _most_ relevant when we are dealing with something that look vaguely like a standard normal distribution (which has mean=0 and standard deviation=1). In those cases, anything with a z-score more than 1.96 standard deviations from the mean is in the 5% significance zone. \n",
    "\n",
    "But remember: we can't really say _why_ one particular area has a high concentration of well-off individuals or why one individual is over 2m tall. All we are saying is that this standardised value is a pretty unlikely outcome _when compared to our expectation that people are randomly distributed across the region_ or _that people have randomly-distributed heights of mean 'x' and standard deviation 'y'_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we _know_ that people aren't randomly distributed around the country in the same way that we know that height isn't genuinely random becuase of the influence of genetics, nutrition, etc. But we need a way to pick out what counts as _**significant**_ over- or under-concentration (or height) from the wide range of 'a bit more' or 'a bit less' than 'normal'. **_If_** a normal distribution does a good job of representing the overall distribution of heights (_whatever_ the reason) then someone of 2m is highly unlikely but we can't say _how_ unlikely until we've placed them on the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put it another way:\n",
    "* Is 10% of wealthy individuals in a small area a high concentration?\n",
    "* How about 20%?\n",
    "* 30%?\n",
    "\n",
    "The only way to answer that question is to use something like the z-score since it standardises all of the values _against the average_. If wealthy people were distributed at random then we would _expect_ that most areas would have about the average concentration. Some areas will have a few more. Some areas a few less. But according to the way that the standard normal distribution works, _nowhere_ should have a z-score of 10. Or 20, since that is 20 standard deviations from the mean and just shouldn't exist in the lifetime of the universe. So if we see that kind of result then we know two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. That our assumption that normal distribution is a reasonable representation of reality breaks down at some point.\n",
    "2. That there are _some_ areas with _highly significant_ over- or under-representation by wealthy residents.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that's ok, because we're trying to set an expectation of what we think we'll see so that we can pick out the significant outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "And here we get to the crux of the issue, most frequentist statistics boils down to this: subtracting **what you expected** from **what you got**, and then dividing by **some measure of spread** to control for the range of the data. We then look at what's _left_ to see if we think the gap between expectations and observations is _meaningful_ or whether it falls within the range of 'random noise'.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be obvious that it's the _**expected**_ part of that equation that is absolutely crucial: we come up with a process that generates data that _represents_ the most important aspects of reality, but we shouldn't imagine that our process has explained them. It's the first step, not the last.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Illustrating Z-Score Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's see how this works... let's take two of the NS-SeC groups: Group 1 and Group 4. And let's investigate their distributions and whether they contain obvious outliers (extremes that shouldn't exist if they were to follow a normal – which is to say: random – distribution). But we _can't_ do this with the raw counts because the raw counts are truncated (you can't have -1 Group 1 households, only positive counts). We'll use the z-score:"

    "## Statistics as Judgement\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no simple answer to when the mean is, or is not, a good measure to use in an analysis. We'll spend a lot more time on this over the coming weeks, but the answer _seems_ to be: it depends what you are trying to accomplish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that you were a researcher planning to undertake some in-person interviews in areas that have high concentrations of well-off households (Group 1, basically). How would you go about choosing which LSOAs to target? How could we use the z-score to make this process a little less 'random' than picking a couple of areas that you know well and trundling off to find... exactly what you expected because your choice was influenced _not_ by data but by _personal bias_?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at this way:\n",
    "1. Remember that _if_ something followed a normal distribution then you would _expect_ 95% of values to fall within the range of -1.96 to +1.96 standard deviations from the mean. So if you wanted 5% 'significance' then you could say \"I'm going to select everything outside of this range as being _significantly_ over- or under-represented in terms of the Group 1 population at the 5% significance level.\"\n",
    "2. If you wanted to select only the _real_ outliers (say, 99.9% 'significance') then you want that z-score of 3.09 that we used above. In both of the cases above we can see that there are values _way_ beyond that level, so we can be pretty certain that there is something non-random happening there.\n",
    "3. The point is that we are moving away from just saying \"Well, it's more than average so it's interesting'. We are actually filtering out a lot areas that might plausibly have higher (or lower) concentrations **'by chance'** _if a normal distribution is a reasonable representation_. We know it's not, but we're stating here that our _naive_ expectation is that people are distributed at random, so what's interesting is the areas where our results show this obviously is _not_ the case. Do you see what I meant above about subtract what we _expected_ from what we _observed_?\n",
    "4. So rather than just saying \"25% of Group 1 households is a lot\" or \"36% of Group 4 households is a lot\" we are finding a way to use the z-score to set a threshold that is less influenced by our own ideas about what is 'significant' and more influenced by what the data actually _says_ is significantly outside 'the norm'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _only_ problem with this approach in this case is that we can tell that our expectation of normality isn't very accurate. The positive skew of Groups 1 and 4 means that we're getting _too many_ areas being flagged as 'significantly over-represented by Group X'. If we were to pick a better distribution, or if we could 'make' the Group distribution _appear_ more like a normal distribution then the z-score would work better for selecting the really interesting cases...\n",

    "\n",
    "[1] _Note_: you don't have to do this analysis at the country level, your 'country' could be a city and your regions be neighbourhoods or districts... basically, any time you have smaller zones nested within a larger one.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, the most straightforward way to think about the LQ more deeply is, perhaps surprisingly, using numbers. What do we get if the LQ is: $\\frac{0.5}{0.25}$? In this case, we'd be saying that 50% of employment in the region of interest is in our sector of interest, while in the country as a whole we would expect 25% of employment to be in that sector. That gives us a LQ of 2, and we can read that directly as being _twice_ as concentrated! If we had the reverse: $\\frac{0.25}{0.5}$ then we'd get 0.5 as the result and we'd know that employment was _half_ as concentrated...\n",

    "text": "The overall assessment package is intended to test students’ comprehension of, and ability to integrate, technical skills with a broader understanding of, and reflection upon, computational approaches to urban research and spatial data science. The assessments are grounded in a mixture of critical reflection and group work that map on to real-world data science challenges, including:\n\nExamining a data set in detail to determine its suitability for tackling a set ‘problem’ or ‘challenge’;\nCollaboratively writing a data-led policy briefing involving high-quality code, analysis, visualisation, and text suitable for use by a policy- or decision-maker;\nReflecting on the successes/failures of a completed project so as to improve future patterns and processes.\n\nCollectively, these assessments provide multiple opportunities to ‘shine’ both individually and as part of a group."

    "text": "The Policy Briefing will present an analysis of data from the Inside Airbnb web site for London. Students may use data from more than one time period if they wish, but this is not required. The briefing will be written as if to update the Mayor of the Greater London Authority on the challenges/opportunities relating to Airbnb’s operations in London. As such, the Policy Briefing will begin with a short Summary, including Key Findings and, if desired, Recommendations; this will be followed by a brief review of the evidence from both London and elsewhere, and then an analysis supported by the data and presented using appropriately generated and selected tables, charts, and maps.\nThe focus of this assessment is the student’s ability to make use of concepts and methods covered in class as part of an analytical process to support decision-making in a non-academic context. It is not necessary that you employ every technique covered in class. It is necessary that you justify your choice of approach with reference to relevant academic and ‘grey’ literature, as well as the computational, statistical, and analytical objectives of your briefing paper. It is perfectly possible to complete this assessment without the use of advanced analytical topics (e.g. clustering, NLP, or global/local/LISA autocorrelation methods); however, it is unlikely that you would be able to complete this assessment to a high standard without some graphs and some maps chosen for their ability to advance your argument.\nThe briefing may be written without substantially new modelling or coding by drawing on the code written in practicals to develop an analysis based on the judicious use of descriptive statistics (see, for instance, Housing and Inequality in London and The suburbanisation of poverty in British cities, 2004-16: extent, processes and nature), but it is likely that a better mark will be obtained by demonstrating the capacity to go beyond exactly what was taught by selectively deploying more advanced programming techniques.\nThis is not an essay, and students who submit a traditional essay format will be penalised in the overall mark. Examples of the kind of format, tone, and content expected are provided below and there will be opportunities to discuss the submission during Term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAlways remember that you are writing this briefing for the Mayor of London! Are they going to know what k-Means Clustering is? Will they care? What makes writing a good briefing hard—and not just about writing good code—is finding the right balance of technical detail and high-level explanation: you can’t just say ‘here are the five types of accommodation we found…’, but you also can’t say ‘we tested clustering solutions in the range 3–50 and found the optimal result at k=12…’ You should have a look at the examples below."

    "text": "We have ‘flipped’ the classroom for this module so we expect you to come to ‘lecture’ (except in Week 1!) having already watched the assigned videos and completed the assigned readings. You may be called upon to present a short summary of the key points in, and relevance of, an assigned video or reading to the rest of the class.\nThis means that there is a mix of ‘asynchronous’ (work that you do in your own time) and ‘synchronous’ (work that we do during scheduled hours) interaction. Synchronous activities will normally be recorded for review afterwards, but you should bear in the mind the following: 1) we cannot be responsible for equipment failure; 2) small-group practicals cannot be recorded; and 3) a 2-hour video of a group discussion and live coding session will be rather less educational and informative than actually being there.\nIn short, recordings should not be used as a substitute for attendance save in exceptional circumstances.\n\n\n\nThe nature and amount of preparation will vary from week to week, but may include:\n\nReadings from both academic and non-academic sources.\nRecorded lectures from CASA staff.\nRecorded videos from non-CASA staff.\nShort Moodle quizzes to test your completion of readings and videos.\nPreparing contributions to set tasks (e.g. summaries of video lectures or readings, Q&A, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nThe ‘lecture’ in your timetable will be used for a mix of discussion and ‘live coding’ (eeek!) using the following framework:\n\nWe will review questions and issues arising from the previous week’s practical session and the weekly Padlet. We will use this to prioritise discussion around concepts and readings with which students are struggling or wish to engage further.\nWe will have a ‘live coding’ session following an ‘I do/We do’ format: we will employ concepts covered in the week’s activities, as well as approaches that will be explored further in the practical, to look a real-world data set together using code.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to make use of these materials you will need to download and install the Spatial Data Science computing environment. Details for this are provided in the Appendix.\nPracticals are run in small groups to maximise your ability to ask questions and interact with other students. You will be notified of your group by the Professional Services team; there may be limited opportunities to switch, but the best way would be to swap with another student and then notify us of the arrangment. You may wish to download the week’s Jupyter notebook before the start of class in order to familiarise yourself with the material.\n\n\n\nTo get the most value from the module you must do the readings even if we are not specifically referencing them in-class because of time-constraints. In previous years students who did not do the readings often failed the first assessment and struggled with the final assessment, leaving a lot of easy marks on the table. More importantly, we believe that the single most important skill that you can acquire from FSDS is not the ability to code, it’s the ability to critically interrogate data and recognise the strengths and limitations that are relevant to the problem at-hand. You will learn the technical aspects of this in the practicals. You will learn the theoretical dimension from doing the readings."

However, you should also see this as preparing the foundation not only for your remaining CASA modules (especially those in Term 2) but also for your post-MSc career: the ability to manage and version code (GitHub); collaborate around a shared codebase (GitHub+Markdown); and produce reproducible code (GitHub+Docker) is integral to modern software development and data science.\nYou should also see this session as connecting to Quantitative Methods Week 1 content on ‘setting quantitative research questions’ since the main assessment will require you to develop a data-led policy briefing. In other words, you’ll need to map current policy on to one or more research questions that can be quantitatively examined using the tools and techniques acquired over the course of the term! While you don’t need to start work on this yet, you should keep it in the back of your mind for when you come across readings/results that you’d like to explore in more detail.\n\n\n\nAlthough none of these activities are compulsory in advance of the first session, getting your computer set up to code does take time and most of these preparatory activites are fairly straightforward… with a few exceptions noted below. If you are able to get these tools installed in advance then you can focus on the taught content in the first two practicals rather than also wrestling with an installation process. This will also give us more time to help you if you discover that you’re one of the unlucky few for whom getting set up is a lot more work!\nComplete as many of these activities as you can:\n\nComplete the quick computer health check.\nHave a go at installing the Command Line Tools for your operating system.\nHave a go at installing the programming environment.\n\nThe last of these is the stage where you’re most likely to encounter problems that will need our assistance, so knowing that you need our help in Week 1 means that you can ask for it much sooner in the practical!\n\n\n\nIn this week’s workshop we will review the module aims, learning outcomes, and expectations with a general introduction to the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges before 22/23\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Learning Outcomes for each week\n\nStandardise delivery by TAs where practicals are TA-led (e.g. FSDS): clearer guidance on how to take students through each week.\n\nClearer articulation of difficulty levels/targets for components within each week’s practicals.\n\nMake links between lecture and practical content explicit; ideally trace a question through the whole process (e.g. “If I wanted to know if and where blue plaques are clustered in London how would I find out?”)\n\n\n\nIf you have already installed the programming environment then the practical can be downloaded from GitHub (Click on Raw and then Save File As...) and viewed by saving it to your Documents/CASA/... folder, or you can just view it online in your web browser since there is no actual coding this week."

You are free to draw on concepts and methods covered in both Quantitative Methods and GIS, but must still write the code in Python (e.g. adapting something from R in the GIS module to Python). Please ensure that your submission includes: the module name, your group’s student ids, and the title of your Policy Briefing.\n\n\nWe will assess reproducibility by selecting “Restart Kernel and Run All” using the sds:2022 Docker environment. If you have made use of another Docker image then you must clearly signpost this at the start of your notebook so that we know to select a different image. We will not install libraries ‘by-hand’ in an ad hoc manner order to test the reproducibility of your work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility\n\n\n\nTo ensure reproducibility, markers must be able to select Kernel > Restart Kernel and Run All Cells... and reproduce your entire analysis. This includes downloading and extracting data, cleaning, transformation, clustering… charts, tables, etc. If you need to provide supplementary or partially-processed data then you can provide this via Dropbox, OneDrive (public sharing link), or some other robust cloud solution that will be accessible from the marker’s system.\n\n\nIf you have made use of one or more libraries that are not part of the Docker image then you can install these as part of your Notebook code using ! pip install; however, if you take this approach then you should also ‘place nice’ by checking first to see if the library is already installed using try... except code that you can find on Stack Overflow and elsewhere (you will need to look this up).\n\n\n\nIt is also up to you to ensure that all relevant data are available via a valid URL: for downloading and running. You may host your data anywhere: a GitHub repo or a Dropbox link or some other resource but note that we may not be able to access resources placed on Chinese web servers so please bear this in mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime-Consuming Code\n\n\n\nIf your analysis has a particularly time-consuming stage (e.g. Named-Entity Recognition or Part-of-Speech tagging) then you can provide partially-processed data: comment out the code up to the point where you have generated the ‘expensive’ data set but leave it in the notebook. That way we can see how you generated the data without it being part of the Restart Kernel and Run All Cells... reproducibility stage."

Many companies (e.g. Apple, Google, etc.) employ an Agile project format in which teams undertake a ‘Retrospective’ at the end of a project in order to identify ways to improve how they work in the future. We are not asking you to do this as a group (indeed, it’s an individual reflection), but we hope that this will help you to develop as a programmer, analyst, or data scientist:\n\nWhat do you think went well in the project?\nWhat did not go well?\nHow do you think the other students in your group would evaluate your contribution to each of these outcomes?\nDescribe one event or experience that gave you new insight into ‘doing’ data science; explain how and why this will be useful to you in the future.\n\nYou can write this using whatever tool you like, but you must address these four questions."

    "text": "Figures and tables used in the Policy Briefing must be generated by Python code cells included in the Reproducible Analysis notebook. You may not modify or create figures in another application since this undermines the reproducibility of the analysis.\n\n\n\nEach figure or table counts for 250 words, and so students should give careful consideration to the trade-offs involved: more figures may serve to illustrate your points but leave you with much less space to synthesise and present and argument.\nA figure with A/B elements will count as one figure, but only where the two parts are conceptually related (e.g. before/after; pre/post; non-spatial distribution/spatial distribution; type 1 and type 2; etc.). Figures with more than two elements (i.e. A/B/C) will count as more than one figure. The only exception to this will be the output from PySAL’s LISA analysis library since that is formatted as 3 figures but they are all conceptually related. Similarly, Seaborn’s jointplot would only be considered one plot even though it is technically three because the distribution plots in the margin are related to the scatter plot that is the focus of the plot.\nIn principle, a briefing with 10 figures would have no space for any text or interpretation; this choice is deliberate because its purpose is to focus your attention on which charts and tables best-communicate your findings. In practice, using A/B figure layouts then you are looking at up to 20 separate figures before hitting the limit, though you would at this point be producing an infographic and not a briefing.\nFigures in the Reproducible Analysis do not count towards your figure total, but you may also not refer to them in your briefing. The briefing must stand on its own. So you don’t need to go through your reproducible code and delete any/all figures that you produced as part of your research process, but you shouldn’t refer to them in the text either."

    "text": "The marking scheme for this submission has two parts:\n\nThe Executive Briefing (60% of total mark for this submission) will be assessed as an essay incorporating analytical elements, with consideration given to the language, presentation, and content of the essay as befits a data-led briefing for a busy executive or policy-maker.\nThe Reproducible Analysis will be assessed on the following criteria:\n\nReproducibility (20% of total mark): we are able to run the entire notebook without errors. Inability to reproduce the output of the notebook may affect our ability to evaluate the student submission in the other two areas.\nAccuracy & Legibility (10% of total mark): the outputs of the notebook (figures and maps, primarily) used in the Executive Briefing are of a high quality in terms of clarity, colour, layout, fonts, labelling, etc.\nQuality of Code (10% of total mark): a holistic view will be taken of the code in terms of its clarity, efficiency, and legibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are able to run the entire notebook without errors.\nNote that it should not be possible to achieve a mark above 13 for submissions that ignored or exceeded the 10MB single Zip file limit or 50MB overall Zip file limit unless it is specifically and clearly explained why this was necessary. The students affected by this are listed at the bottom of this document.\nOne student emailed to say that their NLP analysis would take too long on the full data set so they’ve included the code they ran but commented it out and included a processed data file but I cannot find this email at the moment. This is an acceptable explanation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark\nGuidance\n\n\n\n\n0\nThe notebook cannot be run even after manual intervention (e.g. to correct for obvious errors near the start of the Reproducible Analysis) and no documentation or other guidance has been provided. Code quality is exceptionally poor.\n\n\n5\nThe notebook runs with limited manual intervention (e.g. to correct for missing paths or other trivial errors near the start of the Reproducible Analysis) and no documentation or other guidance has been provided. For example, the notebook requires the marker to do things in order to replicate their analysis (it is not ‘auto-/self-replicating’).\n\n\n10\nThe notebook runs without manual intervention but there is no evidence of thinking about reproducibility. No documentation or other guidance has been provided. It is possible to achieve a mark of 10 with a run-time error later in the analysis.\n\n\n15\nThe notebook runs without manual intervention and there is some evidence of thinking about reproducibility (e.g. there are notes about the use of Docker, or basic information about the data source, etc.). Code may not be fully portable (e.g. the path is platform-specific, or other assumptions about the operating context are made) or documentation, intermediate checks (e.g. outputs to check results of operations), and supporting information may be quite limited.\n\n\n20\nThe notebook demonstrates substantial thought about reproducibility: documentation and guidance are provided at appropriate points, potential error conditions are identified, and the code is fully portable (e.g. os.path.join and os.path.expand(‘~’) are used in place of platform-specific strings).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outputs of the notebook are of a high quality in terms of formatting, clarity, colour, layout, fonts, precision, labelling, etc. This includes figures and tables created in the Reproducible section, but with a particular focus on those used in the Briefing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark\nGuidance\n\n\n\n\n0\nThe default output is used ‘as is’ and no consideration has been given to clarity, colouring, fonts, layout, labelling, etc.\n\n\n5\nSome adjustments have been made to outputs but the results are uneven/poorly presented.\n\n\n10\nConsiderable attention given to all aspects of the figures, maps, and tables, including labelling, precision, colour schemes, fonts, layout, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA holistic view will be taken of the code in terms of its clarity, efficiency, and legibility. This is irrespective of the amount of documentation provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark\nGuidance\n\n\n\n\n0\nThe code appears to be largely copy+pasted from other sources and no consideration has been given to legibility or interpretability.\n\n\n5\nThe code is clear with appropriately-chosen variable names, but it is inefficient with limited use of for loops, dictionaries/lists, functions and other techniques that could streamline the code.\n\n\n10\nThe code is clear, variable names are appropriate, and attention has been given to data structures, use of loops or functions, and other techniques to create clear, legible, and efficient code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve discovered that my guidance was unclear as to whether the Executive Summary was or was not included in the word count. In the event of uncertainty please do not include it towards the overall limit.\n\n\nThe topic of the briefing is one that would interest the target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark\nGuidance\n\n\n\n\n0\nIt is not possible to identify why the topic would be of interest to the target audience because neither the audience nor the relevance of the briefing are clearly identified.\n\n\n5\nAlthough the topic is clearly identified (this may be one of the provided topics, that’s fine), its relevance to the target audience is not clearly established (perhaps because the latter is not clearly stated or no wider connections are drawn).\n\n\n10\nThe intended audience is clearly identified and the value of the briefing to this audience is clearly established but is non-specific in terms of regulatory or market features. Basically, the relevance is obvious, but largely asserted.\n\n\n15\nThe intended audience is clearly identified and the value of the briefing to this audience is clearly established with specific reference to existing or planned regulation(s), or to features of Airbnb’s market (e.g. professionalisation via management firms). Ideally, these are established by referencing recent newspaper articles or other grey literature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe briefing is clearly connected to, and positioned within, a wider context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark\nGuidance\n\n\n\n\n0\nThere briefing shows no awareness of the wider context, and there is no reference to other relevant scales (e.g. to local [Borough], regional [City], national, or international). The bibliography ranges between 0 and 4 articles, the majority of which are technical in nature.\n\n\n5\nThe briefing establishes only a limited context as it is focused entirely on the London (regional) scale and demonstrates limited awareness of the local, national, international scales. The bibliography ranges between 3 and 7 articles, with at least one entry for the London regulatory framework.\n\n\n10\nThe briefing is clearly aware of the wider context with links made to other scales and contexts such that it is clearly positioned within these different contexts. The bibliography ranges between 7 and n articles, with entries of the London and U.K. regulatory framworks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis is clear and focussed, with evidence judiciously selected to support the conclusions and recommendations advanced (as appropriate) to the target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark\nGuidance\n\n\n\n\n0\nThe analysis presented is poor-to-nonexistent and unfocussed with no obvious connection between the work and any conclusions or recommendations made (if any).\n\n\n5\nThe analysis is weak, with the connection between the analysis and any conclusions or recommendations left largely implicit. Evidence is presented without context and with no regard for the audience.\n\n\n10\nAlthough the analysis is weak, direct links to conclusions or recommendations advanced are nonetheless still made. However, there is a reliance on ‘facts’ largely shorn of context and they offer, at best, weak support for the findings presented. There is simply narration of the results of charts and tables with no sense of robust evidence (however indirect) being developed.\n\n\n15\nThe analysis demonstrates clear attempts to connect to any conclusions or recommendations advanced, but weaknesses in the selection or communication of evidence mean that opportunities to strengthen the case are missed.\n\n\n20\nThe analysis is clearly connected to the conclusions and recommendations advanced, but there is a missed opportunity for a ‘less is more’ approach: in other words, there is too much reliance on presenting (relevant) ‘facts’ and not enough space to properly communicate the findings.\n\n\n25\nThe analysis is tightly focussed and evidence has been judiciously selected to support the conclusions and recommendations advanced. There is a clear focus on communicating the relevance of these findings to a non-academic audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA holistic view is taken of the briefing in terms of its clarity and impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark\nGuidance\n\n\n\n\n0\nThe briefing follows a standard essay format and the quality of writing is poor.\n\n\n5\nThere are obvious attempts to adjust to the briefing format, but poor choices in terms of 1) the number and quality of figures and tables; 2) the academic tone of the language used; and 3) the overall ’style’ of the briefing; all work against the overall quality of the submission.\n\n\n10\nThe briefing is well-organised and clear, with figures and tables well-chosen for impact; it is essentially a model for what a data-led briefing could and should look like."

The word limit for this submission is 1,050 words (including the wording of the questions without the material in square brackets—see the template that I have provided). The data set for which the ‘biography’ will be written is the Inside Airbnb data for London.\nThis assessment will be quite straightforward if you have been doing the readings, and rather challenging if you have not.\nThis is a structured assessment that requires you to answer the following questions:\n\nWho collected the data? Consider the source of the data and its relation to the underlying data generating process.\nWhy did they collect it? Consider the purposes for which the data was collected and how this might shape its structure or content.\nHow was it collected? What was the method by which the data was collected and how might this shape its structure, content, or completeness.\nWhat useful information does it contain? Discuss how the data might support a range of analyses and note any limitations encountered so far in class or in your own investigations.\nTo what extent is the data ‘complete’? Reflecting on your earlier answers, and drawing on what you’ve learned about the data so far in class, to what extent is this data a ‘complete’ picture of Airbnb’s operations in London?\nWhat kinds of analysis would this support? Given the issues identified above, what kinds of analysis would this data support? You do not need to propose a specific analysis and should instead focus on generic classes** of analysis.*\nWhich of the analyses outlined above are ethical? Discuss the ethics of these kinds of analysis with reference to the assigned readings."

    "section": "Possible Topics",
    "text": "Possible Topics\nStudents are free to select a narrower or different focus of their briefing; for example, they may wish to develop the evidence either for/against the regulation of listings on Airbnb in London, but the briefing should reference existing policies, where relevant, and may make recommendations based on the analysis undertaken. These are indicative topics and you should feel free to strike out if some other aspect of the topic and data interest you:\n\nImpact of Airbnb on local area rental markets — this would require some assumptions about listings and lettings based on available data but as long as these are clearly stated this would be a strong approach; there are good examples of models used in other cities that it may be possible to draw on, or adapt to, London. You may want to consider things like the type of listing and the issues around the Short- and Long-Term Rental markets.\nImpact of Airbnb on London’s Tourism Economy — this would look at the distribution of London’s tourism venues and, possibly, hotels alongside Airbnb listings in order to evaluate the extent to which tourism ‘dollars’ might be spent in ways that positively impact less tourist-oriented areas if we assume (again, detail the assumptions) that some percentage of a tourist’s dollars are spent locally in an area. Again, there may be models developed elsewhere that could be adapted for the London context.\nOpportunities and Risks arising from Covid-19 — it should/may be possible to assess the impact of Covid-19 on London’s short- and long-term rental markets by looking at entry to/exit from the Airbnb marketplace by comparing more than one snapshot of London data. Again, this will require some reasonable assumptions to be drawn (are all flats withdrawn from Airbnb going back on to the Long-Term Rental Sector?) but these can be documented and justified.\nOpportunities for Place- or Listing-Branding — identifying key terms and features/amenities used to market listings by area and using these to identify opportunities for investment or branding. This would benefit from the use of NLP approaches and, potentially, word embeddings to identify distinctive patterns of word use as well as, potentially, One-Hot encoding to identify specific amenities that appear associated in some way with particular areas.\nThe Challenge of Ghost Hotels — evaluating ways to automatically identify ghost hotels from the InsideAirbnb data and then, potentially, assessing their extent and impact on local areas where they dominate either ‘proper’ hotel provision or other types of listings. You will need to consider the way that Airbnb randomly shuffles listings to prevent exactly this type of application and textual similarity via NLP is an obvious application.\nThe Professionalisation of Airbnb — this could be treated either as a regulatory challenge (is Airbnb not benefiting locals) or an investment opportunity (is this a way to ‘scale’ or develop new service offers for small hosts) depending on your interests. You will need to consider the different types of hosts and evaluate ways of distinguishing between them (e.g. number of listings, spatial extent, etc.).\nImpact Profiles — a geodemographic classification of London neighbourhoods based on how they have, or have not, been impacted by Airbnb. This would require you to think about how to develop a classification/clustering of London neighbourhoods and use data to develop ‘pen portraits’ of each so that policy-makers could better-understand the range of environments in which Airbnb operates and why a 1-size-fits-all regulatory approach may be insufficient. Again, this could be argued from either standpoint or even both simultaneously: these areas are already so heavily impacted that regulation is too little, too late, while these other areas are ‘at risk’."

    "text": "We have ‘flipped’ the classroom for this module so we expect you to come to ‘lecture’ (except in Week 1!) having already watched the assigned videos and completed the assigned readings. You may be called upon to present a short summary of the key points in, and relevance of, an assigned video or reading to the rest of the class.\nThis means that there is a mix of ‘asynchronous’ (work that you do in your own time) and ‘synchronous’ (work that we do during scheduled hours) interaction. Synchronous activities will normally be recorded for review afterwards, but you should bear in the mind the following: 1) we cannot be responsible for equipment failure; 2) we are unable to record practicals and other small-group activities; and 3) a 2-hour video of a group discussion and live coding session will be rather less educational and informative than actually being there.\nIn short, recordings should not be used as a substitute for attendance save in exceptional circumstances.\n\n\nThe nature and amount of preparation will vary from week to week, but may include:\n\nReadings from both academic and non-academic sources.\nRecorded lectures from CASA staff.\nRecorded videos from non-CASA staff.\nShort Moodle quizzes to test your completion of readings and videos.\nPreparing contributions to set tasks (e.g. summaries, Q&A, etc.)\n\nTo get the most value from the module you must do the readings even if we are not specifically referencing them in-class because of time-constraints. In previous years students who did not do the readings often failed the first assessment and struggled with the final assessment, leaving a lot of easy marks on the table. More importantly, we believe that the single most important skill that you can acquire from FSDS is not the ability to code, it’s the ability to critically interrogate data and recognise the strengths and limitations that are relevant to the problem at-hand. You will learn the technical aspects of this in the practicals. You will learn the theoretical dimension from doing the readings.\n\n\n\nThe ‘lecture’ in your timetable will be used for a mix of discussion and ‘live coding’ (eeek!) using the following framework:\n\nWe will review questions and issues arising from the previous week’s practical session and the weekly Padlet. We will use this to prioritise discussion around concepts and readings with which students are struggling or wish to engage further.\nWe will have a ‘live coding’ session following an ‘I do/We do’ format: we will employ concepts covered in the week’s activities, as well as approaches that will be explored further in the practical, to look a real-world data set together using code.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to make use of these materials you will need to download and install the Spatial Data Science computing environment. Details for this are provided in the Appendix.\nPracticals are run in small groups to maximise your ability to ask questions and interact with other students. You will be notified of your group by the Professional Services team; there may be limited opportunities to switch, but the best way would be to swap with another student and then notify us of the arrangment. You may wish to download the week’s Jupyter notebook before the start of class in order to familiarise yourself with the material."

Each of these has pros and cons, but after careful consideration we have come to the conclusion that Docker is the most robust way to ensure a consistent experience in which all students end up with the same versions of each library, difficult-to-diagnose hardware/OS issues are minimised, and running/recovery is the most straightforward.\nSome students are unable to run Docker on their Windows machines, in which case Anaconda Python can be used with the configuration file that we provide. However, if your machine runs Docker then you must use Docker: this isolates the programming environment form your computer, ensuring that nothing is clobbered by accident, and guaranteeing that you are working with the same version of every library that we are. Anaconda is only for emergencies.\nTo install the Programming Environment follow the instructions in Practical 1 here (Task 5, but 4 and 3 are recommended)"

However, in our experience the students most likely to encounter problems share one or more of the following:\n\nYour computer runs Windows 10 Home or older, or MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra) or older.\nYour computer 8GB or less of RAM.\nYour computer has less than 15GB of free disk space remaining.\n\nRead on below to check what specification you have…\nIf you are looking for a recommendation as to what to buy:\n\nDon’t worry about getting the fastest chip, get the most RAM. You should aim for 32GB of RAM, but get more if you can afford it.\nDon’t worry about getting the biggest hard drive, get the fastest one. You should get a SSD (Solid State Drive), but get a M2 type SSD if you can afford it and it’s available for your system.\nOnly once you’ve sorted this out should you look for the fastest chipset that’s still within your budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Operating System and Version is your main computer running?

Each of these has pros and cons, but after careful consideration we have come to the conclusion that Docker is the most robust way to ensure a consistent experience in which all students end up with the same versions of each library, difficult-to-diagnose hardware/OS issues are minimised, and running/recovery is the most straightforward.\nSome students are unable to run Docker on their Windows machines, in which case Anaconda Python can be used with the configuration file that we provide. However, if your machine runs Docker then you must use Docker: this isolates the programming environment form your computer, ensuring that nothing is clobbered by accident, and guaranteeing that you are working with the same version of every library that we are. Anaconda is only for emergencies.\nTo install the Programming Environment follow the instructions in Practical 1 here (Task 5, but 4 and 3 are recommended)"

    "text": "Prior to (re)joining CASA from the Department of Geography at King’s College London, Dr. Mic Ferretti, Dr. Zara Shabrina, Dr. James Millington, and I developed Code Camp.\nCode Camp provides a gentle introduction to the basics of programming in Python. Across ten sessions you will learn about syntax, variables, ‘simple’ data structures such as lists and dictionaries, and about the fundamentals of writing functions for reusable code. The sessions are entirely self-led: you should follow along at your own pace and remember that ‘it’s a marathon, not a sprint’. Don’t cram it all into the last week of summer holidays!\nStudents from previous years have repeatedly said that completing Code Camp helped them to feel more ready for the Foundations of Spatial Data Science module, enabling them to do better on assessments and on the programme as a whole.\nSo please, complete Code Camp by the start of term and, if possible, go through the materials more than once!"

    "text": "We have ‘flipped’ the classroom for this module so we expect you to come to ‘lecture’ (except in Week 1!) having already watched the assigned videos and completed the assigned readings. You may be called upon to present a short summary of the key points in, and relevance of, an assigned video or reading to the rest of the class.\nThis means that there is a mix of ‘asynchronous’ (work that you do in your own time) and ‘synchronous’ (work that we do during scheduled hours) interaction. Synchronous activities will normally be recorded for review afterwards, but you should bear in the mind the following: 1) we cannot be responsible for equipment failure; 2) we are unable to record practicals and other small-group activities; and 3) a 2-hour video of a group discussion and live coding session will be rather less educational and informative than actually being there.\nIn short, recordings should not be used as a substitute for attendance save in exceptional circumstances.\n\n\nThe nature and amount of preparation will vary from week to week, but may include:\n\nReadings from both academic and non-academic sources.\nRecorded lectures from CASA staff.\nRecorded videos from non-CASA staff.\nShort Moodle quizzes to test your completion of readings and videos.\nPreparing contributions to set tasks (e.g. summaries, Q&A, etc.)\n\nTo get the most value from the module you must do the readings even if we are not specifically referencing them in-class because of time-constraints. In previous years students who did not do the readings often failed the first assessment and struggled with the final assessment, leaving a lot of easy marks on the table. More importantly, we believe that the single most important skill that you can acquire from FSDS is not the ability to code, it’s the ability to critically interrogate data and recognise the strengths and limitations that are relevant to the problem at-hand. You will learn the technical aspects of this in the practicals. You will learn the theoretical dimension from doing the readings.\n\n\n\nThe ‘lecture’ in your timetable will be used for a mix of discussion and ‘live coding’ (eeek!) using the following framework:\n\nWe will review questions and issues arising from the previous week’s practical session and the weekly Padlet. We will use this to prioritise discussion around concepts and readings with which students are struggling or wish to engage further.\nWe will have a ‘live coding’ session following an ‘I do/We do’ format: we will employ concepts covered in the week’s activities, as well as approaches that will be explored further in the practical, to look a real-world data set together using code.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to make use of these materials you will need to install the Spatial Data Science programming environment.\nPracticals are run in small groups to maximise your ability to ask questions and interact with other students. You will be notified of your group by the Professional Services team; there may be limited opportunities to switch, but the best way would be to swap with another student and then notify us of the arrangment. You may wish to download the week’s Jupyter notebook before the start of class in order to familiarise yourself with the material."

Explain why there are two assessments and why one has group work with a peer component.\n\nRemove Docker installation practical from FSDS; keep in QM.\n\nJon to create short video on purpose of Docker that can be used in QM and discussed in FSDS (as part of a data science ‘workflow’)\n\nAdd discussion of .gitignore file to GitHub practical (and make sure they add .gz, .csv, and .zip!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis week’s learning objectives are:\n\nA basic understanding of the data science ‘pipeline’.\nAn understanding of how data scientists use a wide range of ‘tools’ to do data science.\nA completed installation/configuration of these tools.\n\n\n\nThis week is focussed on getting you set up for the rest of the course in terms of having the requisite software installed and accounts configured so that you can keep track of your work, write code, and track changes. However, you should also see this as preparing the foundation not only for your remaining CASA modules (especially those in Term 2) but also for your post-MSc career: the ability to manage and version code (GitHub); collaborate around a shared codebase (GitHub+Markdown); and produce reproducible code (GitHub+Docker) is integral to modern software development and data science.\nYou should also see this session as connecting to Quantitative Methods Week 1 content on ‘setting quantitative research questions’ since the main assessment will require you to develop a data-led policy briefing. In other words, you’ll need to map current policy on to one or more research questions that can be quantitatively examined using the tools and techniques acquired over the course of the term! While you don’t need to start work on this yet, you should keep it in the back of your mind for when you come across readings/results that you’d like to explore in more detail.\n\n\n\nAlthough none of these activities are compulsory in advance of the first session, getting your computer set up to code does take time and most of these preparatory activites are fairly straightforward… with a few exceptions noted below. If you are able to get these tools installed in advance then you can focus on the taught content in the first two practicals rather than also wrestling with an installation process. This will also give us more time to help you if you discover that you’re one of the unlucky few for whom getting set up is a lot more work!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nComplete as many of these activities as you can:\n\nGo through the computer health check.\nHave a go at installing the Command Line Tools for your operating system.\nHave a go at installing the programming environment.\n\n\n\nThe last of these is the stage where you’re most likely to encounter problems that will need our assistance, so knowing that you need our help in Week 1 means that you can ask for it much sooner in the practical!\n\n\n\nIn this week’s workshop we will review the module aims, learning outcomes, and expectations with a general introduction to the course.\n\n\n\nLecture\nPresentation\n\n\n\n\nGetting Oriented\nSlides\n\n\nTools of the Trade\nSlides\n\n\nWriting Code\nSlides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges before 22/23\n\n\n\n\n\nStandardise delivery by TAs where practicals are TA-led (e.g. FSDS): clearer guidance on how to take students through each week.\n\nClearer articulation of difficulty levels/targets for components within each week’s practicals.\n\nMake links between lecture and practical content explicit; ideally trace a question through the whole process (e.g. “If I wanted to know if and where blue plaques are clustered in London how would I find out?”)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week’s practical is focussed on getting you set up with the tools and accounts that you’ll need to across many of the CASA modules in Terms 1 and 2, and familiarising you with ‘how people do data science’. Outside of academia, it’s rare to find a data scientist who works entirely on their own: most code is collaborative, as is most analysis! But collaborating effectively requires tools that: get out of the way of doing ‘stuff’; support teams in negotating conflicts in code; make it easy to share results; and make it easy to ensure that everyone is ‘on the same page’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe practical’s learning objectives are:\n\nGet you up and running with coding and collaboration tools.\nProvide you with hands-on experience of using these tools.\nConfigure your programming environment for the rest of the programme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo save a copy of notebook to your own GitHub Repo: follow the GitHub link, click on Raw and then Save File As... to save it to your own computer. From there, move it to your fsds folder and follow the steps to add and push the file to GitHub.\n\n\nIf you have already installed the programming environment then the practical can be downloaded from GitHub. Since there is no code to run this week, you can also view it online in your web browser."

# Foundations (Pt. 2)

## Preparation

### Code Camp

*All* students should complete/revisit [Code Camp](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kingsgeocomp/code-camp-env/notebook-v1.0?urlpath=git-pull%3Frepo%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fkingsgeocomp%252Fcode-camp%26urlpath%3Dtree%252Fcode-camp%252F%26branch%3Dmaster) Notebooks 8â€“11.

**Note:** there is an issue with the GeoJSON tasks in Notebooks 8 and 9. We can discuss in the Workshop.

### Lectures

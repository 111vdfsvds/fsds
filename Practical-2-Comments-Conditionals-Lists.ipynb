    "There is no single accepted way to comment code appropriately and every coder has their own style. However, there are some general points of good practice which we expect you to follow and which will contribute to evaluation of your code assignments. The points are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Include some header information at the top of your program. In the real world this information would likely include your name and contact information but for assignments it should include **only your student id**. The header may also include the date the code was last modified, its purpose and a brief explanation of what the code does.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assume the person reading the code is a coder themselves. This means you do not need to comment everything. For example simple assignments such as `my_variable = 1` or expressions such as `mean = total / count` are obvious enough without needing comments. But if you are creating a temporary variable that will be used later in the code for some purpose, this might be useful to indicate. However, that the use of clear variable (but short) names can mitigate against the need for some comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Good commenting is sparse in the sense that it is precise and concise without being overly verbose. You are not aiming to repeat what the code does, rather you are clarifying what may not be immediately apparent and making it easier to understand For example, `#estimate gap compositions` is preferred over `#here the species composition of all gaps in the forest stand is estimated using a logistic regression model` as the latter contains information that will likely be apparent from other comments and/or the structure of the code itself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Generally we suggest you use only `#` to comment code as although quoted comments might be clear in scripts, they sometimes do not work well at command-line or interpreter. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Feel free to make comments in your code when working that are informal and useful for yourself when writing the code, but when sharing the code (e.g. for an assignment) think about removing these or making them more formal.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. It can be particularly useful to comment blocks of code that conditionally or alternatively execute to keep track of the ‘branch’ of the (imaginary) flow chart the algorithm is on  \n",

## Changes before 22/23

- [ ] Highlight differences from CASA0007; Airbnb data from CASA0005
:::

## Overview

::: {.callout-important}
This week's Learning Outcomes are:

1. An appreciation of how and why this module *differs* from (QM) CASA0007.
2. The beginnings of a more integrative understanding of foundational computer science concepts and the practice(s) of data science.
3. A basic understanding of data acquisition and manipulation in Python.

## Practical

In this practical we will begin working with the InsideAirbnb data, which you will have briefly examined in CASA0005. This week we focus on the first 'class' of data in the data set: simple numeric columns. We will see how to use Pandas for (simple) visualisation and (the beginnings of) analysis. It is hoped that you will see how Pandas combines and builds on techniques that we've already seen: while Pandas is incredibly sophisticated, the underlying *concepts* have been covered in the preceding three weeks! At this point we will also begin to make use of Pandas functionality to subset and explore the data.

## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- [ ] Seeing how Pandas is 'just' a sophisticated extension of what we've already done.
- [ ] Familiarising yourself with Pandas functionality.
- [ ] Performing basic data cleaning and exploration tasks (including visualisation).
- [ ] Selecting and aggregating data in pandas.

## Overview

This week we will dig into data (lists and dictionaries) in greater detail so that you understand how we design structures to store and organise data to simplify our analysis. We will also look at how frequently-used code can be packaged up in functions and libraries. This is the point at which we begin to engage with code in a more abstract way because we are increasingly interested in reusability and flexibility.

This week we start to move beyond Code Camp, so although you should recognise many of the _parts_ that we discuss,  you'll see that we start to put them together in a new way.

**Note:** there is an issue with the GeoJSON tasks in Notebooks 8 and 9. We can discuss in the Class.

## Practical

This week's practical will... 

::: {.callout-tip}
## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- Comparing the use of Python lists and dictionaries to store tabular data.
- Extending lists and dictionaries into nested data structures.
- Beginning to make use of packages to access/interact with data.

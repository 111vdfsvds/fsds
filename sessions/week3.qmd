## Overview

::: {.callout-important}
This week's Learning Outcomes are:

1. 
2. 
3. 
::: 

This week we start to move beyond [Code Camp](https://kingsgeocomputation.org/teaching/code-camp/code-camp-python/). So although you should recognise many of the _parts_ that we discuss,  you'll see that we start to put them together in a new way.

## Preparation

### Code Camp

*All* students should complete/revisit [Code Camp](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kingsgeocomp/code-camp-env/notebook-v1.0?urlpath=git-pull%3Frepo%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fkingsgeocomp%252Fcode-camp%26urlpath%3Dtree%252Fcode-camp%252F%26branch%3Dmaster) Notebooks 8–11.

**Note:** there is an issue with the GeoJSON tasks in Notebooks 8 and 9. We can discuss in the Class.

### Lectures

## Practical

:::{.callout-warning}
## Changes before 22/23
- [ ] Add Learning Outcomes for each week
- [ ] Standardise delivery by TAs where practicals are TA-led (e.g. FSDS): clearer guidance on how to take students through each week.
- [ ] Clearer articulation of difficulty levels/targets for components *within* each week’s practicals.
- [ ] Make links between lecture and practical content explicit; ideally trace a question through the whole process (*e.g.* “If I wanted to know if and where blue plaques are clustered in London how would I find out?”)

The practical can be [downloaded from GitHub](https://github.com/jreades/fsds/raw/master/practicals/Practical-03-Foundations_2.ipynb).

## Overview

::: {.callout-important}
This week's Learning Outcomes are:

1. 
2. 
3. 
::: 

This week we start to move beyond [Code Camp](https://kingsgeocomputation.org/teaching/code-camp/code-camp-python/). So although you should recognise many of the _parts_ that we discuss,  you'll see that we start to put them together in a new way.

## Preparation

- Complete the [short Moodle quiz]({{< var quiz.week3 >}}) asociated with the week's activities.

### Code Camp

*All* students should complete/revisit [Code Camp](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kingsgeocomp/code-camp-env/notebook-v1.0?urlpath=git-pull%3Frepo%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fkingsgeocomp%252Fcode-camp%26urlpath%3Dtree%252Fcode-camp%252F%26branch%3Dmaster) Notebooks 8–11.

**Note:** there is an issue with the GeoJSON tasks in Notebooks 8 and 9. We can discuss in the Class.

### Lectures

Come to class prepared to present:

| Session | Video | Presentation    | Notes |
| :------ | :---- | :-------------- | :---- |
| Dictionaries | [Video]({{< var vids.dicts >}}) | [Slides](../lectures/3.1-Dictionaries.qmd) | [Notes]() |
| LOLs | [Video]({{< var vids.lols >}}) |[Notes](../lectures/3.2-LOLs.qmd) | [Notes]() |
| DOLs to Data | [Video]({{< var vids.dols >}}) | [Slides](../lectures/3.3-DOLs_to_Data.qmd) | [Notes]() |
| Functions | [Video]({{< var vids.functions >}}) | [Slides](../lectures/3.4-Functions.qmd) | [Notes]() |
| Packages | [Video]({{< var vids.packages >}}) | [Slides](../lectures/3.5-Packages.qmd) | [Notes]() |

### Readings

Come to class prepared to present:

- [@Etherington:2016] [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1080/03098265.2015.1086981)
- [@Donoho:2017] [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2017.1384734)
- [@Unwin:1980] [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1080/03098268008708772)

### Activities

- Complete the [short Moodle quiz](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/quiz/view.php?id=24300940) associated with this week's activities.
- Student Dialogue: [Mentimeter poll](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=4389691&forceview=1) to be completed by the start of class.

## Practical

::: {.callout-tip}
## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- [ ] Comparing the use of Python lists and dictionaries to store tabular data.
- [ ] Extending lists and dictionaries into nested data structures.
- [ ] Beginning to make use of packages to access/interact with data.

::: 

:::{.callout-warning}
## Changes before 22/23
- [ ] Standardise delivery by TAs where practicals are TA-led (e.g. FSDS): clearer guidance on how to take students through each week.
- [ ] Clearer articulation of difficulty levels/targets for components *within* each week’s practicals.
- [ ] Make links between lecture and practical content explicit; ideally trace a question through the whole process (*e.g.* “If I wanted to know if and where blue plaques are clustered in London how would I find out?”)

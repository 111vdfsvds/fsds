# Textual Data

:::{.callout-warning}
## Changes before 22/23

- [ ] Still need to do some work on [Analysing Text](../lectures/7.4-Analysing_Text.qmd) possibly by drawing on PH tutorial and other resources.

:::

## Overview

The exploration and analysis of textual data makes working with spatial data seem straightforward, so that's why we've left it for last in terms of types of data that the practicing data scientist can expect to encounter in the wild. The tools and approaches in this area are also evolving quickly and changing rapidly, so this week is intended primarily to familiarise you with the basic landscape in preparation for you developing your skills further in your own time!

## Learning Outcomes

1. An awareness of the benefits of separating content from presentation. 
2. A basic understanding of pattern-matching in Python (you will have been exposed to this Week 2 of CASA0005)
3. A basic understanding of how text can be 'cleaned' to make it more amenable for analysis
4. An appreciation of parallelisation in the context of text processing.
5. An appreciation of how text can be analysed.

### Activities

- Padlet: [Collaborative Agenda]
- Complete the [short Moodle quiz](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/quiz/view.php?id=2555003) associated with this week's activities.

## Practical

In the practical we will continue to work with the InsideAirbnb data, here focussing on the third 'class' of data in the data set: text. We will see how working with text is more complex than working with numeric or spatial data and, consequently, why the computational costs rise accordingly. This practical should suggest some new lines of inquiry for [Data+Policy Briefing](../assessments/briefing.qmd).

## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- [ ] Applying simple regular expressions to find patterns in text.
- [ ] How to clean text in preparation for further analysis.
- [ ] Simple transformations that allow you to analyse text (e.g. TF/IDF)
- [ ] Ways of exploring groups/similarity in textual data.

The practical can be [downloaded from GitHub](https://github.com/jreades/fsds/blob/master/practicals/Practical-07-Textual_Data.ipynb).

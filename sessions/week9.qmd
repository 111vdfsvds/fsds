title: "Visualising Data"
---

## Overview

In order to visualise (geo-)data we often need to link different data sets together, so this week begins by looking at how to join data together in both spatial and non-spatial contexts. As well, since most Python visualisation libraries ultimately depend on matplotlib which is both incredibly powerful and intensely counter-intuitive if you are used to R's ggplot, through maps and charts we'll examine how to interact with data visualisations in Python.

## Learning Outcomes

1. You have familiarised yourselves with how to join and group data in Python.
2. You are beginning to think about developing derived variables and proxies from raw data.
3. You have broadened your thinking about the purpose of data visualisation.
4. You are beginning to think about the final project.

### Lectures

You are *strongly* advised to watch these videos on linking data and spatial data, as well how to group data within pandas; *however*, you will not be asked to present any of these because our attention is now shifting towards the final assessments. You should, by now, be familiar with the concept of how to join data from the GIS module ([CASA0005](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/)), so this is simply a quick tour of how to *do* this in Python.

### Other Preparatory Activities

- You should *still* come to class prepared to present/discuss:
  - [@dignazio:2020, chap. 3] [Pre-review URL](https://bookbook.pubpub.org/pub/8tjbs2x5), *On Rational, Scientific, Objective Viewpoints from Mythical, Imaginary, Impossible Standpoints in Data Feminism*.
  - [@badger:2019] [URL](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/27/upshot/diversity-housing-maps-raleigh-gentrification.html)
- Complete the [short Moodle quiz]({{< var quiz.week9 >}}) associated with this week's activities.
- Student Dialogue: [Mentimeter poll](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=4389765&forceview=1) to be completed by the start of class.

## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- Linking and grouping data as part of a visualisation process.
- Automating the production of map outputs in Python to create an 'atlas'.
- Thinking about proxies; e.g. why would you find ppsqm more/less useful than price? what are you *really* measuring?

## Practical

:::{.callout-warning}
## Changes before 22/23
- [ ] Add Learning Outcomes for each week
- [ ] Standardise delivery by TAs where practicals are TA-led (e.g. FSDS): clearer guidance on how to take students through each week.
- [ ] Clearer articulation of difficulty levels/targets for components *within* each week’s practicals.
- [ ] Make links between lecture and practical content explicit; ideally trace a question through the whole process (*e.g.* “If I wanted to know if and where blue plaques are clustered in London how would I find out?”)
:::

The practical can be [downloaded from GitHub](https://github.com/jreades/fsds/blob/master/practicals/Practical-09-Dimensions_in_Data.ipynb).

# Objects

::: {.callout-warning}
## Changes before 22/23

- [ ] Add Learning Outcomes for each week
- [ ] More focus on code re-use and simplicity.

## Overview

::: {.callout-important}
This week's Learning Outcomes are:

1. 
2. 
3. 
::: 

This week deals with 'objects' and 'classes', which is fundamental to mastering the Python programming language: in Python, *everything* is an object, you just didn't need to know it until now. Understanding how classes and objects work is essential to using Python effectively, but it will also make you a better programmer in any language because it will help you to think about how data and code work _together_ to achieve your goals.

## Practical

::: {.callout-tip}
## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- [ ] Creating functions to perform repetitive tasks
- [ ] Packaging these functions up and accessing via namespace 
- [ ] Exploring the dictionary-of-lists approach to storing data
- [ ] Implementing a few simple classes so that you understand the basics of how they work

## Changes before 22/23

- [ ] Add Learning Outcomes for each week
- [ ] Standardise delivery by TAs where practicals are TA-led (e.g. FSDS): clearer guidance on how to take students through each week.
- [ ] Clearer articulation of difficulty levels/targets for components *within* each week's practicals.
- [ ] Make links between lecture and practical content explicit; ideally trace a question through the whole process (*e.g.* "If I wanted to know if and where blue plaques are clustered in London how would I find out?"")

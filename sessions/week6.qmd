# Spatial Data

## Overview

::: {.callout-important}
## Learning Outcomes

1. You develop better *judgement* about interpreting and representing data.
2. You understand how GeoPandas *extends* Pandas with spatial functionality.
3. You build on material covered in Week 1-3, and 5 of CASA0005 to extend your understanding of mapping and spatial data.
4. You develop better *practices* for (spatial) data exploration.

## Practical

In the practical we will continue to work with the InsideAirbnb data, here focussing on the second 'class' of data in the data set: geography. We will see how to use GoePandas and PySAL for (geo)visualisation and analysis.

## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- [ ] Using Pandas and GeoPandas to create/work with geo-data
- [ ] Making maps in Python with GeoPandas and PySAL
- [ ] Exploring the data visually using `mapclassify`

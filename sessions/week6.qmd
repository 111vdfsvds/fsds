# Spatial Data

:::{.callout-warning}
## Changes before 22/23

- [ ] Add 'Module Dialogue' form, e.g. (to be tweaked):
  - Do you understand what is being taught on the module?
  - Do you know how you will be assessed?
  - Can you access the learning resources?
:::

## Overview

::: {.callout-important}
## Learning Outcomes

1. You develop better *judgement* about interpreting and representing data.
2. You understand how GeoPandas *extends* Pandas with spatial functionality.
3. You build on material covered in Week 1-3, and 5 of CASA0005 to extend your understanding of mapping and spatial data.
4. You develop better *practices* for (spatial) data exploration.

### Activities

- Padlet: [Collaborative Agenda]
- Complete the [short Moodle quiz](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/quiz/view.php?id=2532856) associated with this week's activities.

## Practical

In the practical we will continue to work with the InsideAirbnb data, here focussing on the second 'class' of data in the data set: geography. We will see how to use GoePandas and PySAL for (geo)visualisation and analysis.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- [ ] Using Pandas and GeoPandas to create/work with geo-data
- [ ] Making maps in Python with GeoPandas and PySAL
- [ ] Exploring the data visually using `mapclassify`

The practical can be [downloaded from GitHub](https://github.com/jreades/fsds/blob/master/practicals/Practical-06-Spatial_Data.ipynb).

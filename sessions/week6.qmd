## Overview

::: {.callout-important}
This week's learning objectives are:

1. Get caught up on any rmissed eading(s).
2. Start to think about the research question(s) for your *Policy Briefing*.
3. Start to think about how you *might* ask this question(s) of the data.
::: 

You should be doing the readings that will support your answers to Assessment #2. And, looking ahead to the Final Assessment and where you might find ideas or literature to support your thinking, I'd suggest having a browse of the [Full Bibliography](https://github.com/jreades/fsds/blob/master/bib/Bibliography.md). This is a working document and I will add more items as and when I come across them or new works are published!

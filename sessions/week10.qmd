# Grouping Data

:::{.callout-warning}
## Changes before 22/23
- [ ] Add Learning Outcomes for each week
- [ ] Point to clustering code and show DBSCAN, k-Means, etc. as applied to the Airbnb data. 
- [ ] Stress different view of clustering as part of a pipeline, not an absolute “just k-means it”; link to thinking about paradigms in CASA0001; 
- [ ] thinking about proxies (why would you find ppsqm more/less useful than price? what are you *really* measuring? 
- [ ] Add 'Module Dialogue' form, e.g. (to be tweaked):
  - Do you understand what is being taught on the module?
  - Do you know how you will be assessed?
  - Can you access the learning resources?

Connects to both CASA0001 *and* CASA0007 and CASA0005.

## Practical

:::{.callout-warning}
## Changes before 22/23
- [ ] Add Learning Outcomes for each week
- [ ] Standardise delivery by TAs where practicals are TA-led (e.g. FSDS): clearer guidance on how to take students through each week.
- [ ] Clearer articulation of difficulty levels/targets for components *within* each week’s practicals.
- [ ] Make links between lecture and practical content explicit; ideally trace a question through the whole process (*e.g.* “If I wanted to know if and where blue plaques are clustered in London how would I find out?”)

The practical can be [downloaded from GitHub](https://github.com/jreades/fsds/blob/master/practicals/Practical-10-Grouping_Data.ipynb).

Items collated from previous years' feedback that I've not had time to consider and/or implement yet.

## Mid-Term Changes

- [ ] Change all `height="\d+"` to `r-stretch` on images.
- [ ] Look at [this example](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/advanced.html#auto-animate) for vertically positioning things.
- [ ] Shift focus of (new) Week 9 & 10 to review/discussing the final assessment. Content still available to view/practice but not required/delivered.
- [ ] Require more active use of GitHub/Git -- a submission in which it's easy to automate checks that they've created a repo and populated it with the completed notebooks?
- [ ] Refresh Code Camp and make it more self-test oriented. Use the self-test to set expectations about level of effort/preparation required (and whether or not taking the module will be useful).

title: "Reading Week"

## Overview

Past student performance *strongly* suggests that you should engage with the assigned readings in order to do well on the [Data Audit](../assessments/audit.qmd).

::: {.callout-important}
This week's learning objectives are:

1. Get caught up on any missed reading(s).
2. Start to think about the research question(s) for your *Policy Briefing*.
3. Start to think about how you *might* ask your question(s) of the data.
:::

Looking ahead to the [Data+Policy Briefing](../assessments/briefing.qmd), I'd *also* strongly suggest that you browse the [Full Reference List](../references.qmd) for ideas. The bibliography is a working document and I will add more items as and when I come across them or new works are published, but this is a good time to start chatting with the other people in your group about what you might want to examine!

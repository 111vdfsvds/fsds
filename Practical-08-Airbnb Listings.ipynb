    "This is here to help you if you'd like to download and process the _full_ Airbnb data set. There are something like 96 columns that you could work with, so there's plenty there to sink your teeth into if you so desire. \n",

    "### Randomness & Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the rapid visualisation of the _full_ Airbnb data set using Geopandas/PySAL is hard: there's simply so much of it that visualisation is slow unless you're in a dedicated environment with lots of RAM. So, for the _exploratory_ part of our work we'd normally want to work with a _sample_ -- but what happens if every time we take a sample we get a _different_ sample? That obviously makes things a bit harder, it would be handy if we could get the _same_ random sample every time _while_ we're doing our testing and development before expanding to the full data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where `random.seed` and comes in: by setting a seed we ensure that any process based on a random/random sampling process will be reproducible. In other words, we'll get the _same_ random sample each time. To understand why this happens you'd need to read up on pseudo-randomness and computers but that's not really relevant here. Note, however, that we set the random seed in two places: in Python in general (`random`) and in numpy (`np.random`) because the latter is what Pandas usually uses."

    "4. You'll notice that to create a new `GeoDataFrame` we do so _slightly_ differently from how we created a new `DataFrame` last term: we pass in the existing `pandas` data frame (`sample`), the CRS (projection), and finally the `geometry` that we created from the `zip` process.\n",

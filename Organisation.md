# Module Principles

## Teaching Pattern

### Recorded videos 
- Duration ca. 20 minutes each
- Presentation written in Markdown using [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com) and committed to GitHub.
- Presentation exported as JPEG or PNG and imported to [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) for addition of audio. This means we can record each slide separately (repeatedly if necessary) and then just update what is essential year-on-year. 
- Video uploaded to Moodle (can roll over if no changes). 
- Quiz attached (<5 questions per video to confirm completion and basic comprehension); think this can be done if video sent to MS Streams (rich wolf also give you closed captioning for free). 
- Markdown made available (minus presenter notes?) to students for note-taking. 
### ‘Lecture’ time 
- Review padlet for the week (identify issues with lecture content and previous week’s practical). 
- Discuss readings (incorporate breakouts and reporting back?). 
- I do/we do/(*you do*) — demo stuff relevant for week’s practical but using different data set: “I do”=I will show you how I would approach Todd issue while talking through my thought process; “we do”=we talk through solving same/similar problem as a group. 
### Practical
- Have the installation options (Vagrant, VirtualBox, and YAML file for anaconda python). Vagrant and VirtualBox pull a Docker image into a slim VM. Need to experiment with exporting the conda environment from Docker so that YAML file is consistent. 
- Link from Moodle to raw Notebook on GitHub to minimise year-on-year change (needs a ‘current’ tag?).

# Computer Health Check

Please ensure that your computer is fully up-to-date with Operating System and application updates. Also, please make a note of the following three things:

- What Operating System and Version is your _main_ computer running? [Help for Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running). [Help for Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201260).
- How much RAM does your _main_ computer have? [Help for Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/435644how-to-see-how-much-ram-is-in-your-pc-and-its-speed/). [Helpfor Mac](https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac/much-ram-need-more-3793418/).
- How much free disk space does your _main_ computer have? [Help for Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-free-hard-drive-space-in-windows-2619187). [Help for Mac](https://www.macworld.com/article/2972775/how-to-check-a-mac-free-hard-drive-space.html).

This information will be very useful during the first few weeks when you are most likely to encounter problems with the programming environment. *Generally* speaking, the things to watch out for are:

1. Your operating system is Windows 10 Home, or something older than Windows 10
(*e.g.* Windows 8 or ealier), or MacOS older than 10.13 (High Sierra).
2. Your computer has less than 8GB of RAM.
3. Your computer has less than 15GB of free disk space remaining.

# Using Docker


### Known issues

With Docker on Windows there is _sometimes_ an issue when closing down Docker because the files that you created are not saved and/or you cannot see any of the files on your _main_ system. If this happens to you, the please try replacing this part of the Docker command (detailed elsewhere):

`-v "$WORK_DIR":/home/jovyan/work`

with:

`--mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/home/jovyan/work`

This should enable you to see any existing files that you have, while also being able to save any files that you create in JupyterLab.

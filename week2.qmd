## Changes before 22/23

- [ ] Add Learning Outcomes for each week
- [ ] More focus on code re-use and simplicity.
:::

## Overview

::: {.callout-important}
This week's Learning Outcomes are:

1. 
2. 
3. 
::: 

This week we will be (briefly) reviewing the basics of Python with a view to recapping the more complex aspects of simple data structures. And yes, that's a bit of an oxymoron, but we're focussing here on how computers 'think' and how that differs from what you might be expecting as an intelligen human being! 

We will be contextualising all of this within the longer history of the study of geography through computation. I hope to convince you that many of the problems we face today are _not_ new and why that should encourage you to continue to do the readings!

## Lectures

As we're working in a 'flipped' environment, you should watch these videos *before* class  so that the 'live' workshop can focus on demonstration, discussion, and clarification. This week is very busy because we need to cover off the basics for those of you who were unable to engage with [Code Camp](https://kingsgeocomputation.org/teaching/code-camp/code-camp-python/), while recapping only the crucial bits for those of you who *were* able to do so.

Come to class prepared to present:

## Practical

:::{.callout-warning}
## Changes before 22/23
- [ ] Add Learning Outcomes for each week
- [ ] Standardise delivery by TAs where practicals are TA-led (e.g. FSDS): clearer guidance on how to take students through each week.
- [ ] Clearer articulation of difficulty levels/targets for components *within* each week’s practicals.
- [ ] Make links between lecture and practical content explicit; ideally trace a question through the whole process (*e.g.* “If I wanted to know if and where blue plaques are clustered in London how would I find out?”)
:::

This week's practical requires you to have **completed installation of the programming environment**. The practical can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/jreades/i2p/raw/master/practicals/Practical-02-Foundations_1.ipynb).

# Foundations (Pt. 1)

This week we will be (briefly) reviewing the basics of Python with a view to recapping the more complex aspects of simple data structures. And yes, that's a bit of an oxymoron, but we're focussing here on how computers 'think' and how that differs from what you might be expecting as an intelligen human being! 

We will be contextualising all of this within the longer history of the study of geography through computation. I hope to convince you that many of the problems we face today are _not_ new and why that should encourage you to continue to do the readings!

## Preparation

### Installing Command Line Tools

If you didn't get to this during the practical then *please* do it before we get to Week 2's practical! You need to install one of:

- **Mac:** the Xcode Command Line Tools, which can be done [directly from the Terminal](https://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/).
- **Windows:** WSL 2, for which you can follow [these instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-2-on-microsoft-windows-10).

### Installing the Programming Environment

See the [previous week's instructions](#installing-the-programming-environment). It is *vital* that you try to get this installed **before this week's practical**. If you encounter difficulties we will need time to help you, so the sooner you know that you need help, the faster we can help you.

### Code Camp

If you have ***not* completed [Code Camp](https://kingsgeocomputation.org/teaching/code-camp/code-camp-python/)**, then we would strongly recommend that you tackle *Notebooks 3â€“5* as preparation for the week's class.

### Optional: Git & GitHub

If you would like to have more time to focus on coding, please try to get your local computer and GitHub synchronising your *Introduction to Programming* (suggested name: `i2p`) project. Click on the still below to access the video on Streams.

There are written instructions in the Week's practical.

### Lectures

As we're working in a 'flipped' environment, you should watch these videos *before* class  so that the 'live' workshop can focus on demonstration, discussion, and clarification. This week is very busy because we need to cover off the basics for those of you who were unable to engage with [Code Camp](https://kingsgeocomputation.org/teaching/code-camp/code-camp-python/), while recapping only the crucial bits for those of you who *were* able to do so:

- Watch: [Python: the Basics](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/dc5951ed-33fb-43a7-8e30-19ec2b41cb1f) ([Notes](https://github.com/jreades/i2p/blob/master/lectures/2.3-Python_the_Basics.md))
- Watch: [Lists](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/21ef45cf-c432-4882-be54-e9bdbdaf7a3b) ([Notes](https://github.com/jreades/i2p/blob/master/lectures/2.4-Lists.md))
- Watch: [Iteration](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/ecbf2b2b-6d11-4df0-a28b-caed2badbea1) ([Notes](https://github.com/jreades/i2p/blob/master/lectures/2.5-Iteration.md))
- Watch: [The Command Line](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/5cd2a59c-ab53-4e75-a607-dd5de5e61681) ([Notes](https://github.com/jreades/i2p/blob/master/lectures/2.6-The_Command_Line.md))
- Watch: [Getting Stuck Into Git](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/aa0f7893-4fb5-4af1-ad44-af8e352f4d52) ([Notes](https://github.com/jreades/i2p/blob/master/lectures/2.7-Git.md))

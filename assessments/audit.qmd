# Data Audit (30%)

A Markdown document submitted in Week 6 of teaching (after Reading Week). The word limit for this submission is 1,050 words (including the wording of the questions *without* the material in square brackets—**see the [template that I have provided](https://github.com/jreades/i2p/blob/master/assessments/Data_Biography.md)**). The data set for which the 'biography' will be written is the [Inside Airbnb data for London](https://github.com/jreades/i2p/raw/master/data/src/2020-08-24-listings.csv.gz). 

This assessment will be quite straightforward if you have been doing the readings, and rather challenging if you have not.

This is a structured assessment that requires you to answer the following questions:

1. Who collected the data? *Consider the source of the data and its relation to the underlying data generating process.*
2. Why did they collect it? *Consider the purposes for which the data was collected and how this might shape its structure or content.*
3. How was it collected?  *What was the method by which the data was collected and how might this shape its structure, content, or completeness.*
4. What useful information does it contain? *Discuss how the data might support a range of analyses and note any limitations encountered so far in class or in your own investigations.*
5. To what extent is the data ‘complete’? *Reflecting on your earlier answers, and drawing on what you've learned about the data so far in class, to what extent is this data a ‘complete’ picture of Airbnb's operations in London?*
6. What kinds of analysis would this support? *Given the issues identified above, what **kinds** of analysis would this data support? You do not need to propose a specific analysis and should instead focus on *generic classes** of analysis.*
7. Which of the analyses outlined above are ethical? *Discuss the ethics of these kinds of analysis with reference to the assigned readings.*

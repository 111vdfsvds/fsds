## Data-Led Policy Briefing (50%)

This is a **collaborative project** that you will undertake in a small group of *no more* than three students. The project is intended to resemble real-world data science ways of working: you will be part of a small team, you will need to figure out how to work effectively together, you will need to jointly produce an output in which you all have confidence.

## Group Disputes

In the event that there is *irreconcilable* disagreement within a group, we will use GitHub to determine contributions and inform individual marks. You are therefore **strongly** advised to use GitHub to manage both the *Reproducible Analysis* and the *Policy Briefing*.

:::

Please pay careful attention to the submission process since this is unusually complex thanks to the limitations of Moodle. This assessment consists of _two_ separate submissions:

1. A **Reproducible Analysis** (40% of this assessment; i.e. 20% of module grade) consisting of a Jupyter notebook uploaded as a `.ipynb` file. There is no limit to the amount of code in the *Reproducible Analysis*. [See details](./code.qmd).
2. A **Policy Briefing** (60% of this assessment; i.e. 30% of module grade) consisting of a PDF generated from GitHub Markdown. The word limit for the *Policy Briefing* is 2,500 words. [See details](./briefing.qmd).

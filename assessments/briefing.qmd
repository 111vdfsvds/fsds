# Policy Briefing {.unnumbered}

The *Policy Briefing* will present an analysis of data from the [Inside Airbnb web site for London](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). Students may use data from more than one time period if they wish, but this is not required. The briefing will be written ***as if* to update** the Mayor of the Greater London Authority on the challenges/opportunities relating to Airbnb's operations in London. As such, the *Policy Briefing* will begin with a short Summary, including *Key Findings* and, if desired, *Recommendations*; this will be followed by a brief **review of the evidence** from both London and elsewhere, and then an analysis supported by the data and presented using appropriately generated and selected **tables**, **charts**, and **maps**.

The focus of this assessment is the student's ability to make use of concepts and methods covered in class as part of an **analytical process** to **support decision-making in a non-academic context**. It is *not* necessary that you employ every technique covered in class. It *is* necessary that you **justify your *choice* of approach** with reference to relevant academic and 'grey' literature, as well as the computational, statistical, and analytical objectives of your briefing paper. It is perfectly possible to complete this assessment without the use of advanced analytical topics (e.g. clustering, NLP, or global/local/LISA autocorrelation methods); however, it is unlikely that you would be able to complete this assessment to a high standard without *some* graphs and *some* maps chosen for their ability to advance your argument.

The briefing *may* be written *without* substantially new modelling or coding by drawing on the code written in practicals to develop an analysis based on the judicious use of descriptive statistics (see, for instance, [Housing and Inequality in London](https://www.centreforlondon.org/publication/housing-and-inequality-in-london/) and [The suburbanisation of poverty in British cities, 2004-16: extent, processes and nature](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02723638.2017.1405689)), but it is likely that a *better* mark will be obtained by demonstrating the capacity to go beyond exactly what was taught by selectively deploying more advanced programming techniques. 

This is _not_ an essay, and students who submit a traditional essay format will be penalised in the overall mark. Examples of the kind of format, tone, and content expected are provided below and there will be opportunities to discuss the submission during Term.

Always remember that you are writing this briefing *for the Mayor of London*! Are they going to know what *k*-Means Clustering is? Will they *care*? What makes writing a good briefing *hard*---and not just about writing good code---is finding the right balance of technical detail and high-level explanation: you can't just say 'here are the five types of accommodation we found...', but you *also* can't say 'we tested clustering solutions in the range 3--50 and found the optimal result at `k=12`...' You should have a look at the [examples below](#models-for-executive-briefing).

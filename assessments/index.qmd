# Assessments {.unnumbered}

The overall assessment package is intended to test students' comprehension of, and ability to integrate, technical skills with a broader understanding of, and reflection upon, computational approaches to urban research and spatial data science. The assessments are grounded in a mixture of critical reflection and group work that map on to real-world data science challenges, including:

1. [Examining a data set](./assessments/audit.qmd) to determine its suitability for tackling a set 'problem' or 'challenge';
2. [Collaboratively writing a data-led policy briefing](./assessments/group.qmd) involving high-quality code, analysis, visualisation, and text suitable for use by a policy- or decision-maker;
3. [Reflecting](./assessments/individual.qmd) on the successes/failures of a completed project so as to improve future patterns and processes.

Collectively, these assessments provide multiple opportunities to 'shine' both individually and as part of a group.

# Individual Reflection (20%)

This assessment asks you to reflect *on the process* of 'doing data science' as part of a team, since this format is typical of real-world projects. Many companies (e.g. Apple, Google, etc.) employ an Agile project format in which teams undertake a 'Retrospective' at the end of a project in order to identify ways to improve how they work in the future. We are *not* asking you to do this as a group (indeed, it's an **individual reflection**), but we hope that this will help you to develop as a programmer, analyst, or data scientist:  

1. What do you think went well in the project?
2. What did not go well?
3. How do you think the other students in *your* group would evaluate *your* contribution to each of these outcomes?
4. Describe *one* event or experience that gave you new insight into ‘doing’ data science; explain how and why this will be useful to you in the future.

You can write this using whatever tool you like, but you must address these four questions.

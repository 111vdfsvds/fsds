# Individual Reflection (20%)

This individual assessment due {{< var assess.individual >}} asks you to reflect *on the process* of 'doing data science' as part of a team, since this format is typical of real-world projects. Many companies (e.g. Apple, Google, etc.) employ an Agile project format in which teams undertake a 'Retrospective' at the end of a project in order to identify ways to improve how they work in the future. We are *not* asking you to do this as a group (indeed, it's an *individual* reflection), but we hope that this will help you to develop as a budding analyst or data scientist.

### Format

You must answer these 3 questions:

1. What do you think went well/not well in the project? *3 points; 200 words; Critically engaging with challenges faced by the group will **not** result in a low mark.*
2. How do you think the other students in *your* group would evaluate *your* contribution to each of these outcomes? *12 points; 400 words; Honesty is the best policy here as we may compare your response with that of the rest of the group.*
3. Describe *one* event or experience from the group assessment that gave you new insight into 'doing' data science; explain how and why this will be useful to you in the future. *10 points; 400 words; Try to connect this to either/both of employability and transferrable skills.*

### Word Limit

The word limit for this assessment is **1,000 words**.

### Preparing Your Submission

You are expected to use Markdown+Quarto for this submission and 10 points will be deducted if you do not do so down to a minimum of 50 (i.e. if your original mark was 70 then we would deduct 10 to make your final mark for this assessment 60, but if your original mark was 55 then we would only deduct 5 points). You may be asked to provide evidence that Markdown was used to generate your submission. You are free use the [Data Biography Template](https://github.com/jreades/fsds/blob/master/assessments/Data_Biography.qmd) as a model if you wish. References are not required unless you wish to connect your reflection to specific publications.

# Additional Guidance

## Figures & Tables

Figures and tables used in the *Policy Briefing* **must be generated by Python code cells** included in the *Reproducible Analysis* notebook. You may not modify or create figures in another application since this undermines the reproducibility of the analysis.

## Word Counts

Each figure or table **counts for 250 words**, and so students should give careful consideration to the trade-offs involved: more figures may serve to illustrate your points but leave you with much less space to synthesise and present and argument.

A figure **with A/B elements** will count as one figure, but only where the two parts are conceptually related (e.g. before/after; pre/post; non-spatial distribution/spatial distribution; type 1 and type 2; etc.). Figures with more than two elements (i.e. A/B/C) will count as more than one figure. The *only* exception to this will be the output from PySAL's LISA analysis library since that is formatted as 3 figures but they are all conceptually related. Similarly, Seaborn's `jointplot` would only be considered *one* plot even though it is *technically* three because the distribution plots in the margin are related to the scatter plot that is the focus of the plot.

**In principle**, a briefing with 10 figures would have no space for any text or interpretation; this choice is deliberate because its purpose is to focus your attention on which charts and tables *best*-communicate your findings. **In practice**, using A/B figure layouts then you are looking at up to 20 separate figures before hitting the limit, though you would at this point be producing an infographic and not a briefing. 

**Figures in the *Reproducible Analysis*** do *not* count towards your figure total, but you may also not refer to them in your briefing. The briefing must stand on its own. So you *don't* need to go through your reproducible code and delete any/all figures that you produced as part of your research process, but you shouldn't refer to them in the text either.

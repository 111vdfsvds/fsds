    "Python is a high-level language because computer interprets Python and converts this into yet another language (known as machine language) which it then uses. We can converse with the computer through Python in two ways which we will look at in turn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tIn ‘interactive mode’\n",
    "2.\tIn ‘script mode’\n",
    "\n",
    "In _interactive mode_ Python gives immediate feedback for each statement entered, while running previously entered statements in active memory. Interactive mode is useful for running quick commands and experimeting with code, but is not the best way to save work for later. The Jupyter notebooks are an example of interactive mode so you should be quite familiar with this mode, but we will also see how we can work in interactive mode in other ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "In _script mode_ we save a sequence of Python statements in a file (usually with .py suffix) which is then executed all together. Script mode is useful for saving code to be run again later and to be shared with others. These scripts can be written in a text editor (like notepad) but more often is it easier to develop and edit scripts in an [Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (IDE).\n",
    "\n",
    "The IDE we will be using in Geocomputation is [Spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/). ‘Spyder’ stands for **S**cientific **PY**thon **D**evelopment **E**nvi**R**onment and is a powerful program to help develop, edit, run and test code written in the Python language. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Tip: The file suffix of a Python script file is’ .py’. At its most basic this is simply a text file that you could open in a text editor like notepad, EditPad etc. Depending on the computer and Operating System you are using this file type may be associated with different programs or development environments (like Spyder). ‘Associated’ in this context means that when you double click the file it will open in a given the associated program. In GeoCUP .py files are associated with Spyder_"

    "There is no single accepted way to comment code appropriately and every coder has their own style. However, there are some general points of good practice which we expect you to follow and which will contribute to evaluation of your code assignments. The points are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Include some header information at the top of your program. In the real world this information would likely include your name and contact information but for assignments it should include **only your student id**. The header may also include the date the code was last modified, its purpose and a brief explanation of what the code does.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assume the person reading the code is a coder themselves. This means you do not need to comment everything. For example simple assignments such as `my_variable = 1` or expressions such as `mean = total / count` are obvious enough without needing comments. But if you are creating a temporary variable that will be used later in the code for some purpose, this might be useful to indicate. However, that the use of clear variable (but short) names can mitigate against the need for some comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Good commenting is sparse in the sense that it is precise and concise without being overly verbose. You are not aiming to repeat what the code does, rather you are clarifying what may not be immediately apparent and making it easier to understand For example, `#estimate gap compositions` is preferred over `#here the species composition of all gaps in the forest stand is estimated using a logistic regression model` as the latter contains information that will likely be apparent from other comments and/or the structure of the code itself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Generally we suggest you use only `#` to comment code as although quoted comments might be clear in scripts, they sometimes do not work well at command-line or interpreter. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Feel free to make comments in your code when working that are informal and useful for yourself when writing the code, but when sharing the code (e.g. for an assignment) think about removing these or making them more formal.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. It can be particularly useful to comment blocks of code that conditionally or alternatively execute to keep track of the ‘branch’ of the (imaginary) flow chart the algorithm is on  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Comment your loop structures (you will get to these next week) – the logic underlying these can be difficult to understand later\n"

    "Understanding how to use Git and GitHub effectively is a core element of learning to code. So one of the _first_ things that we are going to do is set you up with an account and a new project.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in order to complete this task you need to:\n",
    "1. Create a login with [GitHub](https://github.com). You may wish to set it up with your UCL email and then link a personal email address as well.\n",
    "2. Using the **#intro-to-programming** channel on [Slack](https://casa-students-2020.slack.com) please share your GitHub acccount handle (*i.e.* [`jreades`](https://github.com/jreades)) by **replying** to Jon's welcome message. This will keep the account names in one place.\n",
    "3. Create a new **private** project directly on GitHub. You might as well call it `i2p` since that's a lot shorter than `intro_to_programming_for_spatial_analysts`.\n",
    "4. Edit the `README.md` file with some information about what's in the project (_e.g._ your notes and practicals for the module).\n",
    "5. Save the changes (this is called a 'commit') and say in a general way what edits you did.\n",
    "6. Work out how to compare the original and edited versions of `README.md` in your browser."

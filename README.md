# Practical responsibilities!

## Jon's practicals:

* 2: Functions, Packages & Methods
    * Use a lib to read a remote file
    * Use string.split to parse CSV data
    * Use a lib to parse CSV data
    * Create a function to read a remote file
    * Create a function to parse CSV data
    * Calculating values derived from CSV data (using function on LoL)
    * Calculating values derived from CSV data (using function on DoL)
* 4: Visualising Data
    * Using pandas with header data
    * Statistics as judgement, not truth -- plotting as first step on this path
    * Seaborn 
    * 3D plots
    * [Interpreting plots and other summary metrics]
    * Saving a plot
    * Automating analysis (loops but over data series now)
* 5: Assessed Notebook
    * _Any content we want to add for practicing for the next week? Or a re-cap assignment?_
* 7: Transformation and Standardisation
    * [From Week 4] Thinking in 'data space' 
    * What counts as extreme?
    * Finding outliers
    * Residuals (first exposure to this)
    * Simple Transformations??? [from Week 4]
    * Simple Standardisations??? [from Week 4]
* 8: Making a Map
    * PySAL and loading shapefiles
    * Look at impact of transforms on understanding of map
    * Joins (non-spatial only?)

## James' practicals:

* 1: Code Camp Recap
    * Scripts vs Notebooks
    * Errors
    * Data Types & Input
    * Operators
    * Comments
    * Conditionals & Logic
    * Loops
    * Lists
    * Dictionaries
* 3: Working with Data (Pandas)
    * Link back to Week 2 and DoL
    * Pandas syntax
    * Quick plots
    * Selection and subsetting
    * Max/Min/Range
    * Searching text
    * Changing column types
    * Working with time data
    * Introducing... AirBnB data? (we dropped APIs, they're now in optional 3b)
      * Also an opportunity to introduce reading .gz/.zip files directly in pandas
* 6: Working with Subsets of Data
    * More on Boolean algebra in pandas selection
    * Links to vector and raster analysis? 
    * Using the index [from Week 4]
    * Finding values, grouping by values, etc. [from Week 4]
    * Sampling data [from Week 4] -- could be very useful for exploring big-_n_ problem so maybe not here?
    * Using loc/iloc (now superseded in some latest pandas???) [from Week 4]
    * Matching on parts of a word, extracting parts of a word [from Week 4]
* 9: Correlation and Residuals
    * Builds on standardisation and normalisation from Week 7
    * Possibly use scipy here since it has rank and Pearson correlation, and is a very well-used lib in the real world
    * Plot residuals on map and in graph! 
    * Seaborn (can include r^2 and rank correlation)
* 10: Aggregation and group-by
    * Brings in issues of scale and, implicitly, MAUP

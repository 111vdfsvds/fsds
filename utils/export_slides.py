# Convert Reveal.js slides to PDF and PNG

# But it boils down to `npm install -g decktape`

# to find the *same content* locally. We do 
# this because we are going to read in the 
# local directory to find all the .qmd files, 
# and then turn around and request those *same*
# files in their rendered format from the Quarto
# server. Otherwise you'd have to have a way to
# navigate the remote web site and, depending on
# how you've structured the site, that might be
# quite difficult. This assumes that most of your
# talks will be in the same folder because that's
# fairly logical in a teaching contenxt.

# Assessments {.unnumbered}

The overall assessment package is intended to test students' comprehension of, and ability to integrate, technical skills with a broader understanding of, and reflection upon, computational approaches to urban research and spatial data science. The assessments are grounded in a mixture of critical reflection and group work that map on to real-world data science challenges, including:

- Examining a data set _in detail_ to determine its suitability for tackling a set 'problem' or 'challenge';
- Working effectively as a group to write high-quality code, analysis, visualisation, and text suitable for use by a policy- or decision-maker;
- Reflecting on the successes/failures of a completed project so as to improve future patterns and processes.

Collectively, these assessments provide multiple opportunities to 'shine' both individually and as part of a group.

## Individual Reflection (20%)

This assessment invites you to reflect upon the group data-led policy briefing _as a process_: what have you learned from doing the assessment, working in a group, and delivering a data science 'product' under deadline?

This is a structured assessment and you must answer the following four questions:

1. What do you think went well in the project?
2. What did not go well?
3. How do you think the _other students_ in *your* group would evaluate *your* contribution to each of these outcomes?
4. Describe *one* event or experience that gave you new insight into ‘doing’ data science; explain how and why this will be useful to you in the future.

Referencing the literature is not _necessary_, though you may have come across readings (or online content) that speak to you and should feel free to cite these if they have informed your thinking. There is no word limit on any one question, but the overall world limit is **XXXX words**.

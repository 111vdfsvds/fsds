    "To a computer, reading data from a remote location (e.g. a web site halfway around the world) is not really any different from reading one that's sitting on your desktop, you just need to make set it up a bit differently and, in Python, make use of a different _package_. In all cases – local and remote – Python gives you a 'filehandle' that supports certain operations like 'open a filehandle', 'read a line', 'close a filehandle'. It's called a filehandle because it's something that gives you a 'grip' on a file-like object.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also want you to understand how we're approaching the problem set out above: we want to read a remote file (i.e. a text file halfway round the planet), turn it into a local data structure (i.e a list or a dictionary), and then perform operations on it using functions (e.g. calculate the mean, find the westernmost city, etc.).\n",

So first we'll get Python _reading_ remote data, then we'll _convert_ text into data, and finally we'll _analyse_ the data using functions.\n",

    "## What's an _Appropriate_ Data Structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you saw when I asked you to calculate the mean population of British cities twice – once using the simple file, and once using the bigger, more complex file – there is a 'problem': our list-of-lists isn't very easy to navigate. Not only _might_ the location of the Population column be different in the two files (as it was, deliberately), but when we want to work out the mean we need to step through a lot of irrelevant data as well (we need to skip past the name, latitude, longitude, etc.). And if I asked you to find the _largest_ city you'd need to do even more work.\n",

    "So how does the experienced programmer get around this? 'Simple': she realises that the data is organised the wrong way! We humans naturally tend to think in rows of data: London has the following _attributes_ (population, location, etc.), and York has a different set of attributes. Se we read across the row because that's the easiest way for us to read it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a computer doesn't have to work that way. For a computer, it's as easy to read _down_ a column as it is to read _across_ a row. In fact, it's easier, because each column has a different _type_ of data: so one column contains names (strings), another column contains population (integers), and other columns contain other types of data (floats, etc.). Better still, the order of the columns often doesn't matter as long as we know what they are called: it's easier to ask for the 'population column' than it is to ask for the 6th column since, for all we know, the population column might be in a different place.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Dictionary of Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we don't mind about column order, only row order (so that we can still link up all of the London data) then a dictionary of lists would be a nice way to handle things. Let's talk this out a bit with some example code, but first, here are the first four rows of data from the simple file:\n",

    "## Review!\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a _lot_ of content to process in the code above, so do _not_ rush blindly on if this is confusing. Stop. Think it through. We'll go through each one in turn, but they nearly all work in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Population of Manchester\n",
    "\n",
    "The code can look pretty daunting, so let's break it down into two parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "What would you get if you ran just this code?\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myData['Population'][0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Remember that this is a dictionary-of-lists (DoL). So, Python first looks for a key named `Population` in the myData dictionary. It finds out that the value associated with this key is a _list_ (`[9787426, 2553379, 2440986]`). And this example, it just pulls out the first value (index 0), which is `9787426`. Does that make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to the second part:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myData['Name'].index('Manchester')\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is very similar: we look in the dictionary for the key `Name` and find that that's _also_ a list (`['London','Manchester','West Midlands']`, since you asked). If you don't remember what `index` does, don't worry, here's the output from Python's `help()` function:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Help on built-in function index:\n",
    "\n",
    "index(...)\n",
    "    L.index(value, [start, [stop]]) -> integer -- return first index of value.\n",
    "    Raises ValueError if the value is not present.\n",
    "```\n",
    "So all we're doing is asking Python to find out the index of 'Manchester' in the list associated with the dictionary key 'Name' _instead_ of just sticking in a `0` to get the first index value. Putting these two things back together what we're doing is:\n",
    "* Finding the index (i.e. **row**) of 'Manchester' in the Name column,\n",
    "* Using that index to read a value out of the Population column (by **row**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Does that make sense? If it does then you should be having a kind of an Alice-through-the-Looking-Glass moment because what we've done by taking a column view, rather than a row view is to make Python's ``index()`` command do the work for us. Instead of having to look through each row for a field that matches 'Name' and then check to see if it's 'Manchester', we've pointed Python at the right column immediately and asked it to find the match (which it can do very quickly). Once we have a match then we _also_ have the row number to go and do the lookup in the 'Population' column because the index _is_ the row number!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Westernmost City\n",
    "\n",
    "Where this approach really comes into its own is on problems that involve maths. To figure out the westernmost city in this list we need to find the _maximum_ Longitude and then use _that_ to look up the right city. So let's do the same process of pulling this appart into two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be _pretty_ obvious what this does:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myData['Name'][0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "But we don't just want the first city in the list, we want the one with the highest longitude. So to achieve that we need to replace the `0` with an index that we found by looking in the `Longitude` list.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myData['Longitude'].index(max(myData['Longitude']))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Ugh, that's still a little hard to read, isn't it? Let's break it down differently:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myData['Longitude'].index(\n",
    "    max(myData['Longitude'])\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "There's the same `.index` which tells us that Python is going to look for something in the list associated with the `Longitude` key. All we've done is change what's _inside_ that index function: `max(myData['Longitude'])` is telling Python to find the _maximum_ value in the `myData['Longitude']` list. So to explain this in three steps, what we're doing is:\n",
    "* Finding the maximum value in the Longitude column (we know there must be one, but we don't know what it is!),\n",
    "* Finding the index (position) of that maximum value in the Longitude column (now we know what the value is!),\n",
    "* Using that index to read a value out of the Name column.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am a nerd, but that's pretty cool, right? In one line of code we managed to quickly find out where the data we needed was even though it involved three discrete steps. Remember how much work it was to find the mean when you were still thinking in _rows_, not _columns_?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Average City Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah, let's try that too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we're going to 'cheat' a little bit: rather than writing our own function, we're going to import a package and use someone _else's_ function. The `numpy` package contains a _lot_ of useful functions that we can call on (if you don't believe me, add \"`dir(np)`\" on a new line after the `import` statement), and one of them calculates the average of a list or array of data.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np # Need to import a useful package\n",
    "mean = np.mean(myData['Population'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is where our new approach really comes into its own: because all of the population data is in one place (a.k.a. a _series_ or column), we can just throw the whole list into the `np.mean` function rather than having to use all of those convoluted loops and counters. Simples, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "By using `numpy` can you figure out how to modify the code above to look at the standard deviation instead of the mean? You might need a refresher as to how to calculate the standard deviation: http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## Review!\n",
    "\n",
    "So the _really_ clever bit in all of this isn't switching from a list-of-lists to a dictionary-of-lists, it's recognising that the latter is a _better_ way to work _with_ the data that we're trying to analyse and that that there are useful functions that we can exploit to do the heavy lifting for us. Simply be changing the way that we stored the data in a 'data structure' (i.e. complex arrangement of lists, dictionaries, and variables) we were able to do away with lots of for loops and counters and conditions, and reduce many difficult operations to something that could be done on one line!

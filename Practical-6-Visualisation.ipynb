    "One of the most frequent applications of adding a new series (i.e. column) to a data set is when we want to transform the original data in some way. Transformations are useful when a data series has features that make comparisons or analysis difficult, or that affect our ability to intuit meaningful difference.

But wouldn't it be handy to be able to examine in more detail how tall students are _relative_ to the mean? Is there someone from the basketball team taking this course? Or maybe the cox from a crew? How could we make it easy to compare the difference between each student and the overall class average in order to spot these 'special cases'?"

    "```python\n",
    "df['Group1ZStd'] = \n",
    "     pd.Series( \n",
    "         (df.Group1 - df.Group1.mean()) / df.Group1.std()\n",

    "### Using the Z-Score\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, there was a long digression about 'data generating processes'; here, we can start to bring this to life. The first thing to do with the z-score is to look at what it implies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Subtracting the mean implies that the mean _is a useful measure of centrality_: in other words, the only reason to subtract the mean is if the mean is _meaningful_. If you are dealing with highly skewed data then the mean is not going to be very useful and, by implication, neither is the z-score.\n",
    "2. Dividing by the Standard Deviation implies that this _is a useful measure of distribution_: again, if the data is skewed or follows some exponential distribution then the standard deviation is going to be near-useless as an analytical tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the z-score is _most_ relevant when we are dealing with something that look vaguely like a normal distribution (the z-scored version of which has mean=0 and standard deviation=1). In those cases, anything with a z-score more than 1.96 standard deviations from the mean is in the 5% significance zone. \n",
    "\n",
    "But note: we can't really say _why_ one particular area has a high concentration of employment or why one individual is over 2m tall. All we are saying is that this standardised value is a pretty unlikely outcome _when compared to our expectation that employment is randomly distributed across the region_. We _know_ that employment isn't randomly distributed in the same way that we know that height isn't genuinely random becuase of the influence of genetics, nutrition, etc. But we need a way to pick out what counts as _**significant**_ over- or under-concentration (or height) from the wide range of 'a bit more' or 'a bit less' than 'normal'.\n",
    "\n",
    "And here we get to the crux of the issue, most frequentist statistics boils down to this: subtracting **what you expected** from **what you got**, and then dividing by **some measure of spread** to control for the range of the data. We then look at what's _left_ to see if we think the gap between expectations and observations was _meaningful_ or whether it falls within the range of 'noise'.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be obvious that it's the _**expected**_ part of that equation that is absolutely crucial: we come up with a process that generates data that is _resembles_ the important dimensions of reality without thinking that the process has explained them. It's the first step, not the lsat."

We use the density (which is a simple proportion) to ensure that we are comparing like-for-like; the proportion controls for the fact that each of the regions has a different number of total employees. \n",

London and New York. But what if there's a small town where 95% of people are bankers, and another town where 80% of people are bakers? Surely that's pretty interesting too, no? What's going on that a place can support way more of these professions that we'd expect...\n",

Well, the mean is one way of defining our expectations -- if you had to guess the height of a new student in your class, your _expectation_ would be based on the heights of the existing students, and the best guess that you could make would be the _average_ height of those students because the majority of students are about that tall.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of our little steel-producing country, we would need to define our expectation a little differently. We're already using a proportion (steelworkers in a region/all workers in a region) to control for the fact that our regions have different sizes. Why not use a _second_ proportion (all steelworkers in the country/all workers in the country) to set our expectations about how concentrated steel employment will be in each area?\n",

And while the replicability of code helps (i.e. you can fix the mistake and then re-run the entire analysis very quickly), you should never assume that you got it exactly right until you’ve double-checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting Your Results\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we interpret the LQ results? Let's start with the two simplest results: 0 and 1. If the LQ is 0 then that means that the denominator (top half of the LQ formula) was 0; there is no employment in the sector of interest in that region. If the LQ is 1 then that means that the top and bottom of the LQ equation were the same; the density of employment in the region is _the same_ as the density in the country as a whole. Anything more than one means a greater density than in the country as a whole.[1]\n",
    "\n",

    "From there, the most straightforward way to think about it more deeply is, perhaps surprisingly, using numbers. What do we get if the LQ is: $\\frac{0.5}{0.25}$? In this case, we'd be saying that 50% of employment in the region of interest is in our sector of interest, while in the country as a whole we would expect 25% of employment to be in that sector. That gives us a LQ of 2, and we can read that directly as being _twice_ as concentrated! If we had the reverse: $\\frac{0.25}{0.5}$ then we'd get 0.5 as the result and we'd know that employment was _half_ as concentrated..."

    "# Exploratory Data Analysis & VDQI\n",
    "\n",
    "If we weren't learning how to program at the same time as we learn to do data analysis then my recommendation would have been this: **start with a chart**. There is _no_ better tool for understanding what is going on in your data than to visualise it, but we couldn't show you how to make a plot without first teaching you how to load data and perform some basic operations on a data frame! Now we can get to grips with VDQI (the Visual Display of Quantitative Information) and how this supports our exploration of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "For data visualisation we are going to use the [Seaborn package](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) because it provides a lot of quite complex functionality (and very pretty pictures) at quite low cost. There are, however, other options out there; the two that you are most likely to hear mentioned are: [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) and matplotlib. Bokeh is, like, Seaborn designed to make it easy for you to create good-looking plots with minimal effort. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a different beast: it is actually the _underlying_ package that supports the majority of plotting (drawing graphs) in Python. So Seaborn and Bokeh both make use of the matplotlib library to create their plots, and if you want to customise a figure from either of these two libraries you will eventually need to get to grips with matplotlib. The reason we don't teach matplotlib is that it's much harder to make a good plot and the syntax is much more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more recent entrant is ŷhat's ggplot library, which deliberately mimics R’s ggplot2 (http://ggplot.yhathq.com) -- this has become the dominant way of creating plots in the R programming language and it uses a 'visualisation' grammar that many people find incredibly powerful and highly customisable. Unfortunately, ggplot on Python does not currently support mapping (which R does in ggplot2).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading Seaborn \n",
    "\n",
    "As with other libraries that we’ve used, we’ll import Seaborn using an alias:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "So to access Seaborn's functions we will now always just write `sns.<function name>()` (where `<function name>` would be something like `distplot`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making a Distribution Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful ways to get a sense of a data series is simply to look at its overall distribution. Something like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%pylab inline\n",
    "series = df.Group1Lq\n",
    "sb.distplot(series)\n",
    "sb.plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `%pylab inline` command only need to be run _once_ in a jupyter notebook; it tells jupyter to show the plots as part of the web page, rather than trying to show them in a separate window. \n",
    "\n",
    "if all at went well you should see a nice distribution plot for the Group 1 Location Quotient! \n",
    "\n",
    "OK, I want you to take a second here: although there was a lot of setup work that needed to be done, we just created a distribution plot in one line of code. One line. This is a more sophisticated plot than you could ever create in Excel and you just created it in one line of code. Try producing similar plots for some of the other groups. Do you understand more about the data and its distribution now?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Saving a Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "Saving a plot isn’t quite as easy as creating one... but wouldn’t be it a lot easier if we could save our plot automatically and not have to even touch a button to do so? This is where we need to use matplotlib syntax (and where you'll see why we opted not to spend too much time on it):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Simple save\n",
    "# Plotting library needed by seaborn\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "fig = plt.figure(series.name)\n",

    "plt.savefig(\"{0}-Test.pdf\".format(series.name), bbox_inches=\"tight\"\n",
    "plt.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "To explain what's happening here: \n",
    "1. We import a package that gives us access to all kind of useful functions.\n",
    "2. We create a 'figure' object into which Seaborn can 'print' its graph\n",
    "3. We call Seaborn and ask it to print (it doesn't really need to know that it's printing to something, it just nees to know what 'device' is should use for output).\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "The plot should have been saved to your working directory with the name of the data series that you were working with (so that you can try doing the same for other data series without overwriting your results!). If you think back a little bit to where we started 6 weeks ago, you’ll see just how far we’ve come, and just how far you can go now: the ability to automatically load, clean, process (e.g. standardise and filter), and print out data in a variety of forms is incredibly powerful. You could repeat an entire analysis simply by changing the input file (assuming the format doesn’t change too much). It’s the automation component that sits at the heart of geocomputational techniques -- you still need individuals and their judgement to figure out what to do and what to produce, but once you’ve done that you can make the computer do the boring stuff while you focus on the interpretation and the meaning of the results!"

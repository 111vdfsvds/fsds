### *Describing* Character Sequences?

Consider the following character sequences:

https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/

> Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
> Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in
> Another moon. But, oh, methinks how slow
> This old moon wanes. She lingers my desires,
> Like to a stepdame or a dowager
> Long withering out a young manâ€™s revenue. (I.i.)

(905) 885-9018

foo@bar.com

^ We need ways to distinguish: Upper and Lower Case, Digits, Space Characters, Other Characters, Repetition, Type... 

---

### Recall...

````python
>>> '123foo456'.index('foo')
2
>>> '123foo456'.split('foo')
['123', '456']
````

These are _like_ list methods, but they're _not_ enough for parsing text.

---

### Regular Expressions

> ... provide a way for talking _about_ patterns observed in text, although their origins are rooted in philosophy and linguistics.

Implemented in Python as:

```python
import re
# re.search(<regex>, <str>)
s = '123foo456'
if re.search('123',s):
  print("Found a match.")
else:
  print("No match.")
```

Prints `Found a match.`

---

### Capturing Matches

```python
m = re.search('123',s)
print(m.start())
print(m.end())
print(m.span())
print(m.group())
```

Outputs:

```python
0
3
(0,3)
123
```

^ So, we have `None` if a search fails, but if it succeeds then we have attributes of the `match` objection like start, end, span, and group (this last is going to be particularly interesting since it tells us what matched).

---

### Configuring Matches

```python
m = re.search('FOO',s)
print(m)
m = re.search('FOO',s,re.IGNORECASE)
print(m)
```

Outputs:

```python
None
<re.Match object; span=(3, 6), match='foo'>
```

The optional third parameter allows us to match newlines (`re.DOTALL`), ignore case (`re.IGNORECASE`), take into account the OS' language (`re.LOCALE`), match across multiple lines (`re.MULTILINE`), and write patterns with comments across multiple lines (`re.VERBOSE`). If you need multiple options it's `re.DOTALL | re.IGNORECASE`. Bitwise again!

---

### More Than One Match

```python
s = '123foo456foo789'
lst = re.findall('foo',s)
print(lst)
lst = re.finditer('foo',s)
[x for x in lst]
rs  = re.sub('foo',' ',s)
print(rs)
rs  = re.split(' ',rs)
print(rs)
```

Outputs:

```python
['foo','foo']
[<re.Match object; span=(3, 6), match='foo'>, <re.Match object; span=(9, 12), match='foo'>]
'123 456 789'
['123', '456', '789']
```

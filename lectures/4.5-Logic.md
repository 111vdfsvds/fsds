# Logic for Toddlers

Layout: Split
### Do You Want?

Consider the following three things I've said to my toddler:
1. Do you want to go to the park **and** have ice cream?
2. Do you want cereal **or** toast?
3. Do **not** touch that again!

Unlike my toddler, the computer *does* listen, but my toddler has more sense!

### In Code Now

Using 'Booleans' (True/False) let's set `x=True`, `y=False`, and `z=False`:
```
if x:
  print("x")
if x and y:
  print("x and y")
if x or y:
  print("x or y")
if x and not y:
  print("x and not y")
if x or y or z:
  print("x or y or z")
```
I'm offering my toddler three choices: `x="going to park"`, `y="doesn't want ice cream"`, `z="won't touch it again"`

### Combining Logic With Operators

Remember that operators like `<=` and `==` also produce True/False answers. So *that* means that:
```
x = y = 5
z = 3
if x==y:
  print("x==y")
if x==y and x==z:
  print("x==y and x==z")
if x==y or x==z:
  print("x==y or x==z")
if x==y and not x==z:
  print("x==y and not x==z")
```

---
## A Special Case

There is a **second set** of logical operators that apply in very specific circumstances. These are called 'bitwise' operators and apply to data specified in **bits**.

| Regular Operator | Bitwise Equivalent |
| :--------------- | :----------------- |
| `and` | `&` |
| `or`  | `|` |
| `not` | `~` | 

Let's see (briefly) how these work...

---
### Working With Bits
Let's set `x=38` and `y=3`:
```
print(f"{x:b}") # `:b` means byte-format
print(f"{y:b}")
```
This gives us that `x` is `'100110'` and `y` is `'11'`, so now:
```
print("{0:b}".format( x & y ))
> 10
print("{0:b}".format( x | y ))
> '100111'
print("{0:b}".format( x & ~y ))
> '100100'
```

---
### Perhaps Easier to See This Way?

| Operator | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| x | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 
| y | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| x & y | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| x \| y | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| ~y | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| x & ~y | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

Bitwise operations are *very*, *very* fast and so are a good way to, say, find things in large data sets. **You've been warned.**

### In / Not In

We've touched on these before:
```
g = ['Harvey','Rose','Batty','Jefferson']
if 'Batty' in g:
  print("In the group!")
if 'Marx' not in g:
  print("Not in the group!")
```
There is also a `set` data type that supports `in`, and `not in`.

^ This is a good place for a recap though.

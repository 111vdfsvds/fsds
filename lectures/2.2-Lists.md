# Lists

In the same way that a paper shopping list holds many 'types' of shopping in one place, a Python list holds many 'types' of data in one place.

```python
myList = [1, 3, 5, 7]     # homogenous list
myList = [1, "dog", 7.01] # heterogenous list 
myList = []               # empty list
```

Python lists are *always* recognisable by their "square brackets": `[...]`

## Accessing Lists

#### Why is a Python list like a lift in Europe, and *not* like an elevator in America?

Worked example:

```python
geographers = ["Massey", "Harvey", "Rose"]
```

---

Lists are 'indexed' _numerically_ from the **zero**-th element:

| [Massey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doreen_Massey_(geographer)) | [Harvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey) | [Rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian_Rose_(geographer)) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0                                                            | 1                                                    | 2                                                            |

```python
>>> print(geographers[1])
Harvey
```

---

We can also use *variables* as list indexes:

| Massey | Harvey | Rose |
| ------ | ------ | ---- |
| 0      | 1      | 2    |

```python
>>> i = 0
>>> print(geographers[i])
Massey
```

---

*Anything* that evaluates (i.e. resolves) to a number can be used as an index:

| Massey | Harvey | Rose |
| ------ | ------ | ---- |
| 0      | 1      | 2    |

```python
>>> i = 1
>>> print(geographers[i+1])
Rose
>>> print(geographers[ (i-2+1)*2 ])
Massey
```

---

### Countdown!

We can 'count' backwards from the *end* of the list using *negative* numbers:

```python
>>> print( geographers[-1] )
Rose
>>> print( geographers[-2] )
Harvey
```

---

### Aaaaaaargh!

Errors can be scary... but informative

```python
>>> print( geographers[5] )
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range

>>> print( geographers[1.25] )
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not float
```

Although there is quite a lot of output for such a simple mistake, notice that Python is giving us important hints about the source of the problem:

> IndexError: **list index out of range**
>
> TypeError: **list indices must be integers or slices, not float**

---

### Slicing Lists

You can access more than one element at a time using a *slice*:

```python
>>> print( geographers[0:2] )
['Massey','Harvey']
>>> print( geographers[1:2] )
['Harvey']
>>> print( geographers[1:] )
['Harvey', 'Rose']
>>> print( geographers[-2:] )
['Harvey', 'Rose']
```

The syntax for a slice is: `list[ <start_idx>, <end_idx> ]` What can be confusing is that the end index (`end_idx`) is *not* included in the slice. This is why `[1:2]` only returns a slice with one element.

^ It's really subtle, but notice that a slice *always* returns a list, even if it's just a list containing one thing.

---

The following are all valid slices:

```python
geographers[start:end] # gives items start through end-1 
geographers[start:]    # gives items start through all of the list 
geographers[:end]      # gives items from start through end-1 
geographers[:] 	       # gives a copy of the whole list
```

And they will all return a list![^1]

[ ^1 ]: Provided that `start` and `end` are valid indices!

---

### Test Yourself

What do you think this will produce?

```python
>>> i = 2
>>> print( geographers[ (i-3)**2-4:-1 ] )
```

See if you can work out in your head before typing it!

----

## Finding Things in Lists

`list.index(...)` tells you where something can be found in a list:

```python
>>> geographers.index("Harvey")
1
>>> geographers.index("Massey")
0
```

Combining ideas that will become very useful later:

```python
print(geographers[ geographers.index("Massey") ])
```

What do you think this prints? Why does it work at *all*?

^ This last example looks a little strange, but what if I had a separate list with *first* names, or Wikipedia links, or other information about these geographers? Because `list.index(x)` returns an integer we can use it *as* an index for accessing lists.

---

### Sorting

We can sort lists in alpha-numerical order:

```python 
geographers.sort()
print(geographers)
['Harvey', 'Jefferson', 'Massey']
```

And we can reverse-sort them too:

```python
geographers.sort(reverse=True)
print(geographers)
['Massey', 'Jefferson', 'Harvey']
```

---

## Changing Lists

### Lists are Mutable 

Mutable == "liable or subject to change or alteration"

```python
>>> geographers = ["Massey","Harvey","Rose"]
>>> geographers[2] = "Jefferson"
>>> print(geographers)
['Massey','Harvey','Jefferson']
```

### Adding/Removing Items in Lists

When we `insert()` items into, or `pop()` items out of, a list we normally need to specify the index. 

```python
>>> geographers = ["Massey","Harvey","Rose"]
>>> geographers.insert(0,"von Humboldt")
>>> print(geographers)
['von Humboldt', 'Massey', 'Harvey', 'Rose']
>>> geographers.insert(3,"von Humboldt")
>>> print(geographers)
['von Humboldt', 'Massey', 'Harvey', 'von Humboldt', 'Rose']
```

And in 'reverse':

```python
>>> geographers.pop(3)
'von Humboldt'
>>> print(geographers)
['von Humboldt', 'Massey', 'Harvey', 'Rose']
```

---

### Test Yourself

There are **two ways** to remove David Harvey from the list of geographers _without_ writing this:

```python
>>> geographers.pop(2) # This is not the answer!
```

1. You can *adapt* an [example we saw earlier](#finding-things-in-lists) in 'Finding Things'.
2. You can [use Google](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+remove+an+item+from+a+list+in+python). 

---

## Combining Lists

---

### Concatenation

We can combine lists using addition:

```python
>>> female_geographers = ['Rose','Valentine','Massey','Jefferson']
>>> male_geographers = ['Von Humboldt','Harvey','Hägerstrand']
>>> all_geographers = female_geographers + male_geographers
>>> print(all_geographers)
['Rose', 'Valentine', 'Massey', 'Jefferson', 'Von Humboldt', 'Harvey', 'Hägerstrand']
>>> print(all_geographers[0])
Rose
```

---

### Appending

Appending does something a bit different:

```python 
>>> female_geographers = ['Rose','Valentine','Massey','Jefferson']
>>> male_geographers = ['Von Humboldt','Harvey','Hägerstrand']
>>> all_geographers = []
>>> all_geographers.append(female_geographers)
>>> all_geographers.append(male_geographers)
>>> print(all_geographers)
[['Rose', 'Valentine', 'Massey', 'Jefferson'], ['Von Humboldt', 'Harvey', 'Hägerstrand']]
>>> print(all_geographers[0])
['Rose', 'Valentine', 'Massey', 'Jefferson']
```

What do you think has happened here?

---

### Test Yourself

```python
>>> male_geographers = ['Von Humboldt','Harvey','Hägerstrand']
>>> male_geographers.append('Batty')
```

What do you think `print(male_geographers)` will produce? And why do you think that `append` **appears** to do something different in these two examples?

---

## Finally...

---

### How many geographers do I know?

`len(...)` gives you the **len**gth of 'countable' things:

```python
>>> geographers = ["Massey","Harvey","Rose"]
>>> len(geographers)
3
```

But...

```python
>>> female_geographers = ['Rose','Valentine','Massey','Jefferson']
>>> male_geographers = ['Von Humboldt','Harvey','Hägerstrand']
>>> all_geographers = []
>>> all_geographers.append(female_geographers)
>>> all_geographers.append(male_geographers)
>>> print( len(all_geographers) )
2
```

---

### Who's in the List?

```python
>>> geographers = ["Massey","Harvey","Rose"]
>>> print("Massey" in geographers)
True
>>> print("Batty" in geographers)
False
```

But... 

```python
>>> geographers = ["Massey","Harvey","Rose"]
>>> geographers.index('Massey')
0
>>> geographers.index('Batty')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: 'Batty' is not in list
```

Thinking *logically* why might you choose one of these over the other? 

---
### Test Yourself

How would you change this code:
```python
>>> geographers = ["Massey","Harvey","Rose"]
>>> print("Massey" in geographers)
True
>>> print("Batty" in geographers)
False
```

So that it prints:
```python
False
True
```

You will have seen the answer to this in Code Camp, but you can also [Google the it](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=find+out+if+an+item+is+not+in+a+list+python)!

# Geopandas
## Pandas Learns about Maps

---
## Two Key Geo-Libraries in Python

### Geopandas
'Geospatial Pandas' provides a set of tools for working with *geo-data* in a pandas-like way. See: [GeoPandas.org](https://geopandas.org/).

### PySAL
The Python Spatial Analysis Library provides an array of tools for performing spatial *analysis*. Now uses geo-pandas as default data structure. See: [PySAL.org](https://pysal.org/).

## Basic Functionality

---
### Reading & Writing

Supported file formats:

| Type | Extension | Notes |
| :--- | :-------- | :---- |
| Shape | `.shp` (and various) | Maximum compatibility |
| GeoPackage | `.gpkg` | Good default choice |
| GeoJSON | `.geojson` | For web mapping |
| Zip | `.zip` | For use with Shapefiles |

Additionally, it is possible to read only [subsets of the data](https://geopandas.org/io.html#reading-subsets-of-the-data) using row, column, geometry, and bbox filters.

---
### Reading (Remote Files)

Again, depending on file size you may want to save these locally, but...

```python
import geopandas as gpd
gpkg_src = 'https://github.com/jreades/i2p/blob/master/data/src/TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.3.gpkg?raw=true'
world = gpd.read_file(gpkg_src)
world.plot(facecolor='white', edgecolor='darkblue')
```

---
### Writing (Local Files)

```
world.to_file('world.gpkg', driver='GPKG')
```

^ If you forget to specify the driver this writes shapefiles to a directory called `world.gpkg`!

---
## Data Structures

GeoPandas does all this by adding two new classes:

- [GeoDataFrame](https://geopandas.org/data_structures.html#geodataframe)
- [GeoSeries](https://geopandas.org/data_structures.html#geoseries)

In principle, a GeoSeries can contain multiple geo-data types, but in practice you'll want to be one of the following `shapely` classes:

1. Points / Multi-Points
2. Lines / Multi-Lines
3. Polygons / Multi-Polygons

---

### Consider

We can ask if a particular object is an *[instance](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_isinstance.asp)* of any given class:

```python
print(isinstance(world, str))
print(isinstance(world, gpd.GeoDataFrame))
print(isinstance(world, pd.DataFrame))
```

Prints: `False`, `True`, `True`.

^ So converting from Pandas to GeoPandas works well because GeoPandas knows all about Pandas.

^ You can use a GeoDataFrame anywhere you'd use a DataFrame with no loss of functionality!

---

### Projections

Depending on your data source, you may or may not have projection information attached to your GeoDataFrame:

```python
print(world.crs)
```

Prints: `epsg:4326`. 

You can pretty much find any EPSG you might need at [epsg.io](http://epsg.io/). By far the most commonly-used _here_ are:

- [EPSG:4326](WGS 84 -- WGS84 - World Geodetic System 1984, used in GPS) for the World Geodetic System 84 used in GPS.
- [EPSG:27700](http://epsg.io/27700) for OSGB 1936/British National Grid used in the UK.

_Note_: large territories (such as Canada, China and Russia) may well have _multiple_ projections.

---

### Reprojection

For data sets _without_ projection information (i.e. anything loaded from a shapefile) you must `gdf.set_crs(<spec>)`. For all others you should `gdf.to_crs(<spec>)`.

```python
world2 = world.to_crs('ESRI:54030')
world2.plot()
```

Different geometry columns can have different projections.

---

### Standards?

> Can you think why the _European Petroleum Standards Group_ is one of the big drivers behind (and users of) high-quality projection data?

^ _Hint_: you _really_ don't want to miss _<what>_?

---

### The Spatial Index

We can use Geopandas' spatial index directly to perform simple spatial queries:

```python
wslice = world.cx[-50:50, -20:20]
ax = wslice.plot()
```

### Attributes

A GeoSeries has attributes like any other Series, but also includes some spatially-specifc ones:

- `area` — if a polygon
- `bounds` — for each feature
- `total_bounds` — for each GeoSeries
- `geom_type` — if you don't already know
- `is_valid` — if you need to test

---

### Methods

Additional GeoSeries methods icnlude:

- `distance()` — returns `Series` measuring distances to some _other_ feature (called as: `<GeoSeries>.distance(<feature>)`)
- `centroid` — returns `GeoSeries` of **strict** centroids (called as: `<GeoSeries>.centroid`)
- `representative_point()` — returns `GeoSeries` of points **within** features
- `to_crs` and `plot`, which you've already seen.

---

### Relationship Tests

Simple geographical tests:

- `geom_almost_equals()` — tries to deal with rounding issues when comparing two features.
- `contains()` — is shape contained within some _other_ features.
- `intersects()` — does shape intersect some _other_ features.

---

## Point Data

### Converting Non-Spatial Data 1

Lat/Long and Northing/Easting benefit from a helper function:

```python
url = 'https://bit.ly/3owocdI'
df  = pd.read_csv(url)

gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(df,      geometry=gpd.points_from_xy(df['longitude'], df['latitude'], crs='epsg:4326'))
gdf.plot()
```

^ You can also use list comprehensions (`[x for x in list]`) and `zip` to combine two lists!

^ Notice that the default plot from a GeoDataFrame is... a map!

---

### Converting Non-Spatial Data 2

Other feature types need to be in some kind of regular format such as [Well-Known Text](https://www.vertica.com/docs/9.2.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/AnalyzingData/Geospatial/Spatial_Definitions/WellknownTextWKT.htm) (WKT), [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/), or something readable as a Shapely geometry.

```python
bbox = 'POLYGON((5000000.0 2500000.0, 5000000.0 -2500000.0, -5000000.0 -2500000.0, -5000000.0 2500000.0, 5000000.0 2500000.0))'
from shapely import wkt
bgdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame({'id':[0], 'coordinates':bbox})
bgdf['geometry'] = bgdf.coordinates.apply(wkt.loads)
bgdf = bgdf.set_crs('ESRI:54030')
```

^ These are more rarely used for our purposes but knowing that they exist is useful.

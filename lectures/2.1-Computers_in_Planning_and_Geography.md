# Computers in Urban Studies

>  All of this may seem very new and very scary if you have a 'traditional' background in Planning, Geography, or Urban Studies in general. But...

### Wave 1

“A computer in every institution”:

- Roughly the 1950s–70s

- Computers as **‘super-human’ calculators** for data

- Data + models as theory-testing tool

Retrospectively: the ‘first quantitative revolution’.

^ Many see this as incorrect and focus on the theoretical aspect.

---

### Wave 2

“A computer in every office”:

- Roughly the 1980s–2000s

- Computers as tools for **thinking about spatial relationships**

- Explicit modelling of local spatial effects

Retrospectively: the ‘GIS revolution’.

^ I also see this as incorrect because GIS is Wave 1.

---

### Wave 3

“A computer in every thing”:

- Roughly the mid-2000s–?

- Computers as tools for **generating data** (*pace* ABM researchers)

- Geodata being continuously produced as byproduct of other activities

- Shift from researching attributes to behaviours (*pace* Hägerstrand)

Retrospectively: the ‘big data revolution’ or ‘2nd quantitative revolution’.

^ Shift from computers as processors of data **to integrated, pervasive systems** that spew out data on *everything*.

### All Waves Still Going!

**Wave 1: Computers help me do it** **faster**

- GIS is ‘just’ the industrial revolution impacting cartography.

**Wave 2: Computers help me to** **think**

- Geocomputation & local stats are qualitatively & meaningfully different.

**Wave 3: Computers help me to learn**

- Not ‘just’ about the ‘bigness’ of data, though that is important.

^ Wave 2 is about implementing ideas such as recursion and iteration – these could, in theory, have been tackled in Wave 1, but in practice that’s not what people were doing.

^ Wave 3 is about more explicitly allowing computers to learn about data so that we can extract insight from these models – these could also, in theory, have been tackled in Wave 2 but in practice that’s not what people were doing.

^ I’m not totally happy about my description of Wave 3 and will try to dig into this in a little more detail but suggests welcome!

### Anticipated by Hägerstrand (1967), Natch

> “I think that the computer can do three different and useful things for us. The first and simplest operation is straightforward **descriptive mapping**… the second and more important function is the **analytical one**… The third kind of service is perhaps the most interesting and promising. This service is to run **process models** by which we might try to reproduce observed or create hypothetical chains of events of a geographical nature.” (emphasis in original)

### But Persistent Critiques

>  There is a clear disparity between the sophisticated theoretical and methodological framework which we are using and our ability to say anything really meaningful about events as they unfold around us. There are too many anomalies between what we purport to explain and manipulate and what actually happens. There is an ecological problem, an urban problem, an international trade problem, and yet we seem incapable of saying anything of any depth or profundity about any of them. When we do say something it appears trite and rather ludicrous.

## Data Science to the Rescue?

![left fit](/Users/jreades/Documents/git/i2p/lectures/img/Sexy_Job_of_21C.png)

Data… *science*?

- Industry-led

- Spatially ignorant (often)

- Disciplinarily greedy (often)

^ Personally, I think that you get to danger zones everywhere here, not just at the intersection between hacking and substantive expertise.

### What *is* Different About Data Science?

According to Donoho (2017) DS differs from plain old ‘statistics’ through an emphasis on, and interest in:

1. Data gathering, preparation, and exploration; 

2. Data representation and transformation; 

3. Computing with data; 

4. Data visualisation and presentation; 

5. Data modelling; and

6. A reflexive ‘science of data science’.

### In Practice...

I think there are several distinguishing features that I encounter in day-to-day (geography) work:

- Data-driven methods development & deployment

- Explicit tuning/meta-parameterisation

- Explicit feature optimisation/engineering

- Explicit training/testing from ‘one shot’ data

- ‘Black boxes’ feature prominently & ‘online learning’ emerging quickly

Data science as **process** and **pipeline**, not just **input** to research.

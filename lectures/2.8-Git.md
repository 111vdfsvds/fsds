## Getting Started with Git

### What You Will Need

You will need two things to get started:

1. A `git` client on *your* computer: [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. A GitHub account: [github.com](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)

---

### Learning More

We will be making use of Git throughout this module, but you can use it *anywhere* that you have files that are changing (*hint:* essays, notes, projects, assessments...) and need to track them. 

**Bonus:** using GitHub you *also* have free backup!

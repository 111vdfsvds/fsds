## Getting Started

In order to read a file you need to know a few things:

- What distinguishes **one record** from another?
- What distinguishes **one field** from another?
- What ensures that a field or record **is valid**?
- Does the data set have **row or column names**? (a.k.a. headers & metadata)

## Real Tabular Data

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td colspan="5">Office for National Statistics</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td colspan="5">CT0512 - Workplace table: Industry (2 digits)</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Total</td>
    <td>01 Crops...</td>
    <td>02 Forestry...</td>
    <td>03 Fishing...</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>East of England</td>
    <td>715,950</td>
    <td>4,239</td>
    <td>87</td>
    <td>131</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>E02003616</td>
    <td>1,202</td>
    <td>11</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>E02003617</td>
    <td>767</td>
    <td>19</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>E02003618</td>
    <td>857</td>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>E02003619</td>
    <td>1,166</td>
    <td>18</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

^ We'd divide this up into: Metadata; Column Names (a.k.a. the 'Headers'); Row Names (a.k.a. the 'Index'); and Data.

### Structure of a Tabular Data File

Row and column names:
1. Make it a lot easier to find and refer to data (_e.g._ the 'East of England row' or the 'Total column');
2. But they are **not data** and don't belong in the data set itself.

^ Pro tip: if we store column and row names separately from the data then we can access everything easily without having to factor in any ‘special’ values!

### Distinguishing One *Record* from Another

How do we know where one record (a.k.a. observation) finishes and the next one starts?

- Usually it's a 'newline' (`\n`) or 'carriage return (`\r`) or both (`\r\n`).
- But it *could* be anything (e.g. `EOR`).

^ Noice also the \r and \n here. This is the first time we've seen something called an escape sequence. You will encounter them when dealing with the Shell as well: remember that `\ ` is necessary if you have a space in your file name or path. Same idea.

---
### Distinguishing One *Field* from Another

How do we know where one field (a.k.a. attribute or value) of a record finishes and the next one starts?

- The most common is the comma (`,`) which gives rise to CSV (Comma-Separate Values).
- Tabs (`\t`) are also common, but it could be anything (`;` or `|`).

![](mi_question_answer)  How would we **choose** a good field separator?

> Readings data is a **very** common challenge so... chances are that there is a package or class that can help us to do this! You **don't** need to tell Python how to read Excel files, SQL files, web pages... find a package that does it for you!

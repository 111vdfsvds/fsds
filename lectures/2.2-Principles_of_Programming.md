# Principles of Programming

---

## What is Programming *About*?

---

### According to the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zp92mp3/revision/1) & [Google](https://edu.google.com/resources/programs/exploring-computational-thinking/index.html#!ct-overview)...

Programming is about:

- **Decomposition**: breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller, more manageable parts.

- **Pattern recognition**: looking for similarities among and within problems.

- **Abstraction**: focusing on the important information only, ignoring irrelevant detail.

- **Algorithms**: developing a step-by-step solution to the problem, or the rules to follow to solve the problem.

---

### But what About Computational *Thinking*?

Computational thinking is *not* thinking like a Computer Scientist. It *is* about recognising how to code can help us to understand, and manipulate, the world.

---

Aspects of computational thinking include:

- Recognising how one problem connects to *other* problems (you do this already when you *generalise* from your readings to your ideas).

- Recognising when and how to make things *simpler* and *faster* (see: the [3 Virtues of the Programmer](http://threevirtues.com/)).

- Recognising how different ways of tackling a problem gives you *power* to tackle new problems.

See [this keynote](https://youtu.be/TWxwKDT88GU?t=3120) by Lorena Barba (2014); esp. from 52:00 onwards.

### Why Are These Virtues?[^1]

1. Laziness
2. Impatience
3. Hubris

*Note:* see also [Larry Wall's "Three Virtues of a Programmer" are Utter BullðŸ’©](https://hackernoon.com/larry-walls-three-virtues-of-a-programmer-are-utter-bullshit-fykp32ck)

^ Automate the boring stuff, focus on the interesting bits! And it's not about *quantity* of code, it's about *quality*.

^ Use code to save time, but don't just jump head-first into problems.

^ When something isn't working well you *want* to make it work better/faster/more efficiently...

[^1 ]: Not to be taken literally!

### Four Quotes to Remember

In orderâ€¦

1. *Computers make very fast, very accurate mistakes.*

2. *A computer program does what you tell it to do, 
    not what you want it to do.*

3. *Only half of programming is coding. 
    The other 90% is debugging.*

4. *Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning.*

---

### And One More...

*Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.*â€”Oscar Wilde

---

## Algorithms

---

### What's an Algorithm?

It's a recipe for solving a problem.

---

### Following a Recipe is Easy, Right?

---

### Calculating the Mean

Given these numbers, what's the average?

1, 4, 7, 6, 4, 2

---

### As a Recipe

1. Take a list of numbers
2. Start a *count* of numbers in the list at 0
3. Start a *sum* of numbers in the list at 0
4. Take a number from the list:
   - Add 1 to the *count*
   - Add the value of the number to the *sum*
5. Repeat step #4 until no numbers are left in the list.
6. Divide the *sum* by the *count*
7. Report this number back to the user

---

### As Python

```python
numbers = [1, 4, 7, 6, 4, 2]
total   = 0
count   = 0
for num in numbers:
  total = total + num 
  count = count = 1
mean = total / count
print(mean)
```

### Why We Still Haven't 'Solved It'

---

Computers are *good* at:

- Doing *exactly* what they are told.
- Doing it *over and over* indefinitely.

Computers are *not good* at:

- Solving problems that you can't define.
- Creating new knowledge.

---

## Languages

Computer languages come with all of the â€˜baggageâ€™ of human languages; they have:

- A vocabulary (reserved words)

- A grammar (syntax)

- Rules about the kinds of things you can say

- Styles and idiosyncrasies all their own

In this module we will use the Python programming language. We could *also* teach this same content in R.

---

### Python

```python
numbers = [1, 4, 7, 6, 4, 2]
total   = 0
count   = 0
for num in numbers:
  total = total + num 
  count = count = 1
mean = total / count
print(mean)
```

---

### R

```R
numbers = c(1, 4, 7, 6, 4, 2)
total   = 0
count   = 0
for (num in numbers) {
  total = total + num
  count = count + 1
}
mean = total / count
print(mean)
```

---

### Naming Variables

Other rules for variable names:

- They cannot start with a number (e.g. `3items` is invalid)

- White space and symbols (e.g. `$`, `+`, etc) are **not** allowed, but `_` (underscore) *is* allowed (e.g. `my_variable` is fine)

- Case matters: `myVar` is different from both `myvar` and `MYVAR`

- Be consistent: `my_var` is more 'Pythonic', though `myVar` is also widely used, but don't mix these!

- Variable names should be long enough to be clear but not so long as to be impractical: `bldg_height` vs. `bh` vs. `max_building_height_at_eaves`.

---

### Names to Avoid

You should not try to use *any* of these words as a variable. Python may not complain, but strange things will happen.

| All      | of      | these  | are    | reserved |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| and      | del     | from   | not    | while    |
| as       | elif    | global | or     | with     |
| assert   | else    | if     | pass   | yield    |
| break    | except  | import | print  |          |
| class    | exec    | in     | raise  |          |
| continue | finally | is     | return |          |
| def      | for     | lambda | try    |          |

---

### Variables Have Types

| Name    | Value                        | Type                                                         |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| msg     | 'Hello world'                | `type(msg)==str`                                             |
| answer  | 42                           | `type(answer)==int`                                          |
| pi      | 3.14159                      | `type(pi)==float`                                            |
| correct | True                         | `type(correct)==bool`                                        |
| print   | `builtin_function_or_method` | [It's complicated...](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12347647/python-test-whether-object-is-a-builtin-function) |

As well see next week, everything is *also* an object.

### Syntax (A Well-Formed Command)

The most common sources of syntax errors are:

1. Incorrect Indenting;
2. Missing colons on conditional code;
3. Unbalanced parentheses

---

```python
if hours > 0:
print("Hours were worked.")
else
	print "No hours were worked.")
```

---

```python
if hours > 0:
  print("Hours were worked.")
else:
	print("No hours were worked.")
```

---

### Syntax Errors (A Poorly-Formed Command)

Output from the Python interpreter:

```python
>>> if hours > 0:
...     print("Hours were worked.")
... else
  File "<stdin>", line 3
    else
       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>>     print "No hours were worked.")
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print "No hours were worked.")
    ^
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

---

### Make Your Life Easy (Easier)

Always comment your code:

1. So that you know *what* is going on.
2. So that you know *why* it is going on.
3. So that others can *read your code*.
4. To help you *plan* your code

^ You are reminding your future self what your code was *for* and helping to give it structure (explaining==thinking!).

---

```python
# This is a comment
print("Foo")
print("Bar") # Also a comment
# You can have multiple comments
# like this before code. And even
# keep code from running
# print("Baz")
```

---

```python
#  Process occupational data
def occ_data(df):
    #  Columns of interest
    occ = ['Managerial','Professional','Technical','Administrative','Skilled','Personal Service','Customer Service','Operators','Elementary']
    
    # Integrate results into single dataset -- 
    # right now we don't replicate Jordan's approach of
    # grouping them into 'knowledge worker' and 'other'. 
    occ_data = pd.DataFrame()
    ...
```

---

These are not really comments, but can help when you have a really long comment to make:

```python
"""
So I was thinking that what we need here is 
a way to handle the case where the data is
incomplete or contains an observation that we
weren't expecting (e.g. "N/A" instead of "0").
"""
```

---

### Commenting Tips

- Include general information at the top of your code

- Assume the person reading the code is a coder themselves

- Good commenting is sparse in the sense that it is precise and concise without being overly verbose

- Conditional execution: comments useful to track flow

- Loops: logic can be difficult to understand later

---

### Finally: Style

Although all programmers develop their own *style* (see: writing in *any* language), Python encourages coders to use a *consistent* style so that others can pick up your code and make sense of whatâ€™s going on (see: comments!).

Two useful resources:

- [*The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python*](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/)

- [*A summary of Python code style conventions*](https://robinwinslow.uk/2014/01/05/summary-of-python-code-style-conventions/)

---

Languages differ in what is considered good â€˜styleâ€™, but good code is consistent in being **readable**. Donâ€™t combine coding and cryptography.

*Itâ€™s okay to figure out murder mysteries, but you shouldnâ€™t need to figure out code. You should be able to read it.*â€”Steve McConnell

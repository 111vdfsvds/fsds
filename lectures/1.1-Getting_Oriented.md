### ~~Timetable~~How We Are Running Things... 

- **Lectures**: pre-recorded and I will do everything in my power to make them available to you the Thursday *before* the 'lecture'.
- **Padlet**: available to you at the same time as the lecture. We will use this as the group whiteboard to help prioritise challenges, share triumphs, understand the readings.
- ~~Lecture~~**Workshop**: Mondays 1–3pm. We will refer to the Padlet to guide the first half of the workshop. The second half will be 'live coding' in an **I do/We do** format.
- **Practical**: *either* Mondays 4–6pm *or* Wednesdays 10am–12pm

---

### Assessments

- **Timed Technical Skills Assessment @ 15%** (2 hours; 3 for those with *Inclusion Plans*): A time-limited coding test designed to test students' technical competency and understanding of concepts covered in the module.
- **Structured Reflective Essay @ 25%** (1,000 words max): A structured reflective essay in which students are prompted to reflect on their understanding of the interactions between the technical and theoretical elements of the module.
- **Briefing with Coding Elements @ 60%** (2,500 words max): A data-led briefing in which students present, for example, a technical analysis that might inform public policy or market research.

^ Assessment #1 is also intended to give us a baseline for where students are at early in the course so that we can identify those in need of additional support.

---

### How to 'Ace' the Assessments?

*Study* like you're learning a new language. *Do* the readings. *Talk* to other students.

---

### Study Aids

- [Google](https://www.google.co.uk) 
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python)
- [Slack](https://www.slack.com)

^ Google will become more useful as you learn more and this is definitely one class in which "I Googled it" is a *good* answer.

^ As of early September, Stack Overflow contains over 1.5 *million* Python questions alone! Chances are someone else has had your question before.

^ We'll talk about Slack more [later](./1,4-Tools_of_the_Trade.md)

## Where Does I2P Fit?

#### Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

- Foundations of spatial analysis

- Working with geo-data

#### Quantitative Methods (QM)

- The principles of working with data

- Working with data

#### Intro to Programming (I2P)

- Applying concepts from GIS & QM

- Developing programming skills from scratch

## What Are We Trying to Do?

This class hopes to achieve three things:

1. To teach you the basics of how to *code* in Python.
2. To teach you the basics of how to *think* in Python (or any other language).
3. To show you how the concepts *taught* in GIS and Quantitative Methods can be *applied* to a practical (spatial) data analysis problem.

---

### Also...

We hope to convince you that you *can* code. 

Learning to code does *not* require mathematical ability.

Learning to code does *not* require linguistic ability.

Learning to code *does* require practice. And more practice. And more again.

---

If you only code during the practical session then you will *not* learn how to code. 

If you cram the night before then you will *not* learn how to code.

If you do 60 minutes every other night, then you *will* learn how to code.

## Computers in Planning & Geography

All of this may seem very new and very scary if you have a 'traditional' background in Planning or Geography. But... 

---

### Wave 1

“A computer in every institution”:

- Roughly the 1950s–70s

- Computers as **‘super-human’ calculators** for data

- Data + models as theory-testing tool

Retrospectively: the ‘first quantitative revolution’.

^ Many see this as incorrect and focus on the theoretical aspect.

---

### Wave 2

“A computer in every office”:

- Roughly the 1980s–2000s

- Computers as tools for **thinking about spatial relationships**

- Explicit modelling of local spatial effects

Retrospectively: the ‘GIS revolution’.

^ I also see this as incorrect because GIS is Wave 1.

---

### Wave 3

“A computer in every thing”:

- Roughly the mid-2000s–?

- Computers as tools for **generating data** (*pace* ABM researchers)

- Geodata being continuously produced as byproduct of other activities

- Shift from researching attributes to behaviours (*pace* Hägerstrand)

Retrospectively: the ‘big data revolution’ or 
 ‘2nd quantitative revolution’.

^ Shift from computers as processors of data **to integrated, pervasive systems** that spew out data on *everything*.

---

### All Waves Still Going!

**Wave 1: Computers help me do it** **faster**

- GIS is ‘just’ the industrial revolution impacting cartography.

**Wave 2: Computers help me to** **think**

- Geocomputation & local stats are qualitatively & meaningfully different.

**Wave 3: Computers… help me to *learn***

- Not ‘just’ about the ‘bigness’ of data, though that is important.

^ Wave 2 is about implementing ideas such as recursion and iteration – these could, in theory, have been tackled in Wave 1, but in practice that’s not what people were doing.

^ Wave 3 is about more explicitly allowing computers to learn about data so that we can extract insight from these models – these could also, in theory, have been tackled in Wave 2 but in practice that’s not what people were doing.

^ I’m not totally happy about my description of Wave 3 and will try to dig into this in a little more detail but suggests welcome!

### Anticipated by Hägerstrand (1967), Natch

“I think that the computer can do three different and useful things for us. The first and simplest operation is straightforward **descriptive mapping**… the second and more important function is the **analytical one**… The third kind of service is perhaps the most interesting and promising. This service is to run **process models** by which we might try to reproduce observed or create hypothetical chains of events of a geographical nature.” (italics in original)

*T.* *Hägerstrand* (1967), ‘The Computer and the Geographer’, *TiBG*

---

### But Persistent Critiques

There is a clear disparity between the sophisticated theoretical and methodological framework which we are using and our ability to say anything really meaningful about events as they unfold around us. There are too many anomalies between what we purport to explain and manipulate and what actually happens. There is an ecological problem, an urban problem, an international trade problem, and yet we seem incapable of saying anything of any depth or profundity about any of them. When we do say something it appears trite and rather ludicrous.

*Harvey (1972, p.6)*

## Data Science to the Rescue?

![left](/Users/jreades/Documents/git/i2p/lectures/img/Sexy_Job_of_21C.png)

Data… *science*?

- Industry-led

- Spatially ignorant (often)

- Disciplinarily greedy (often)

^ Personally, I think that you get to danger zones everywhere here, not just at the intersection between hacking and substantive expertise. 

---

### What *is* Different About Data Science?

According to Donoho (2017) DS differs from plain old ‘statistics’ through an emphasis on, and interest in:

1. Data gathering, preparation, and exploration; 

2. Data representation and transformation; 

3. Computing with data; 

4. Data visualisation and presentation; 

5. Data modelling; and

6. A reflexive ‘science of data science’.

---

### In Practice...

I think there are several distinguishing features that I encounter in day-to-day (geography) work:

- Data-driven methods development & deployment

- Explicit tuning/meta-parameterisation

- Explicit feature optimisation/engineering

- Explicit training/testing from ‘one shot’ data

- ‘Black boxes’ feature prominently & ‘online learning’ emerging quickly

Data science as **process** and **pipeline**, not just **input** to research.

### Do We Need It?

## Some Perspective

Risks of de-skilling of geography and planning at one end, and being subsumed by data science at the other…

![](/Users/jreades/Documents/git/i2p/lectures/img/Harris_Tweet.png)

---

### The Down-Side

Here are the challenges:

- Completely different style and rate of learning from other modules (“I didn't anticipate, or rather factor into my schedule, the amount of out-of-ours practice that was required to stay up to date”).

- (Re)Learning stats *and* programming *at the same time* and then need to connect this all back to geography.

- Delayed gratification (you have to walk before you can run).

- Easy to fall behind and hard to catch up (“the pace is relentless”).

---

### The Up-Side

Here are the rewards:

- Skills that are highly transferrable and highly sought-after professionally.

- Problem-solving and practical skills that are valued by the private and public sectors.

- A whole new way of seeing the world and interacting with it.

- Lots of support along the way… *if you remember to ask for it!*

---

### Implications

You will learn to code *best* if you treat it like learning a new language:

- Regular practice works *much* better than cramming

- Find reasons to immerse yourself in the language

- Discuss with your friends (*i.e.* Slack)

- Do the readings (*even* if we don’t address them specifically)

- Start simple and work up

- Start with learning how to ask questions (*i.e.* Search Stack Overflow)

- Subscribe to a ‘magazine’ or two (*e.g.* Medium or Pocket)

- Google is your friend (really)

### Learn from Your Mistakes

![](/Users/jreades/Documents/git/i2p/lectures/img/Learning_from_Mistakes.png)

## One More Thing...

This year (in particular) we are *all* learning new ways to do things. You will get things wrong. I will get things wrong. We will assume that you are trying your best. We would appreciate it if you assumed the same about us!

It's going to be messy, but I'm *really* excited about it!

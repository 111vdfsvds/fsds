### ~~Timetable~~How We Are Running Things... 

- **Lectures**: these will be pre-recorded and divided up into shorter segments that are easy to follow. I will do everything in my power to make them available to you by the Thursday *before* the 'lecture'.
- **Padlet**: this is an online tool that we will use as the group whiteboard to help prioritise challenges, share triumphs, reflect on the readings.
- ~~Lecture~~**Workshop**: Mondays 1–3pm. Your input to the Padlet will guide the first half of each week's 'workshop'. The second half will be 'live coding' in an **I do/We do** format.
- **Practical**: *either* Mondays 4–6pm *or* Wednesdays 10am–12pm. This will be the **You do** part.

---

### Assessments

- **Timed Technical Skills Assessment @ 15%** (2 hours; 3 for those with *Inclusion Plans*): A time-limited coding test designed to test students' technical competency and understanding of concepts covered in the module.
- **Structured Reflective Essay @ 25%** (1,000 words max): A structured reflective essay in which students are prompted to reflect on their understanding of the interactions between the technical and theoretical elements of the module.
- **Briefing with Coding Elements @ 60%** (2,500 words max): A data-led briefing in which students present, for example, a technical analysis that might inform public policy or market research.

^ Assessment #1 is also intended to give us a baseline for where students are at early in the course so that we can identify those in need of additional support.

---

### How to 'Ace' the Assessments?

*Study* like you're learning a new language. *Do* the readings. *Talk* to other students. *Ask* for help when you need it!

^ More on how to ask for help below!

## Where Does I2P Fit?

#### Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

- Foundations of spatial analysis

- Working with geo-data

#### Quantitative Methods (QM)

- The principles of working with data

- Working with data

#### Intro to Programming (I2P)

- Applying concepts from GIS & QM

- Developing programming skills from scratch

## What Are We Trying to Do?

This class hopes to achieve three things:

1. To teach you the basics of how to *code* in Python.
2. To teach you the basics of how to *think* in Python (or any other language).
3. To show you how the concepts *taught* in GIS and Quantitative Methods can be *applied* to a practical (spatial) data analysis problem.

---

### Also...

We hope to convince you that you *can* code. 

Learning to code does *not* require mathematical ability.

Learning to code does *not* require linguistic ability.

Learning to code *does* require practice. And more practice. And more again.

---

If you only code during the practical session then you will *not* learn how to code. 

If you cram the night before then you will *not* learn how to code.

If you do 60 minutes every other night, then you *will* learn how to code.

---

## A Bit of Perspective

Risks of de-skilling of geography and planning at one end, and being subsumed by data science at the other…

![](/Users/jreades/Documents/git/i2p/lectures/img/Harris_Tweet.png)

---

### The challenges:

- Completely different style and rate of learning from other modules (“I didn't anticipate, or rather factor into my schedule, the amount of out-of-ours practice that was required to stay up to date”).

- (Re)Learning stats *and* programming *at the same time* and then need to connect this all back to geography.

- Delayed gratification (you have to walk before you can run).

- Easy to fall behind and hard to catch up (“the pace is relentless”).

---

### The rewards:

- Skills that are highly transferrable and highly sought-after professionally.

- Problem-solving and practical skills that are valued by the private and public sectors.

- A whole new way of seeing the world and interacting with it.

- Lots of support along the way… *if you remember to ask for it!*

---

### Implications:

You will learn to code *best* if you treat it like learning a new language:

- Regular practice works *much* better than cramming

- Find reasons to immerse yourself in the language

- Discuss with your friends (*i.e.* Slack)

- Do the readings (*even* if we don’t address them specifically)

- Start simple and work up

- Start with learning how to ask questions (*i.e.* Search Stack Overflow)

- Subscribe to a ‘magazine’ or two (*e.g.* Medium or Pocket)

- Google is your friend (really)

# Getting Help

---

### Study Aids

When you need an answer *right now*:

- [Google](https://www.google.co.uk) 
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python)

When you want to *learn more*: 

- [Medium](https://medium.com/search?q=python)
- [Pocket](https://app.getpocket.com/search/python)

^ Google will become more useful as you learn more and this is definitely one class in which "I Googled it" is a *good* answer.

^ As of early September, Stack Overflow contains over 1.5 *million* Python questions alone! Chances are someone else has had your question before.

---

### *Before* You Ask for Help

From the [Computer Science Wiki](https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/How_to_ask_for_help):

- Create a diagram of the problem
- Draw a picture of the problem
- Explain the problem to a rubber duck (really)
- Forget about a computer; how would you solve this with a pencil and paper?
- Think out loud
- Explain the problem to a friend

To which I would add:

- Add lots of `print(variable)` statements to your code!

^ We'll cover this last bit as we get more used to coding!

---

### *Where* to Ask for Help

There is *no* shame in asking for help. None. We are here to support your learning and we have chosen a range of tools to support that:

- [**Slack**](https://www.slack.com): use public #i2p (*Introduction 2 Programming*) channel for help with coding, practical, and related course questions.
- **Office Hours**: use Teams to contact PGTAs and lecturers for 1:1 help with software, hardware, and more complex issues.
- **Out-of-Hours**: use Email to raise personal circumstances and related issues for focussed support. Make use of Professional Services support as-needed to preserve privacy.

^ We'll talk about Slack more [later](./1,4-Tools_of_the_Trade.md), but we think that this is the best way to get help when you need it. Slack enables us to support you as a community of learners across computer / tablet / phone.

---

### *When* to Ask for Help

- When you get warning messages from your computer's Operating System.
- When you cannot get the coding platform to run.
- When even simple commands return line-after-line of error code.
- When you have no clue what is going on or why.
- When you have been wrestling with a coding question for more than 20 minutes (but see: *How* to Ask for Help!)

^ In order to learn you *do* need to struggle, but only up to a point! So we don't think that *giving* you the answer to a coding question as soon as you get stuck is a good way for you to learn. At the same time, I remain sad to this day that one of the most insightful students I've ever had dropped out of our module after 10 weeks because they didn't realise that they were having with their computer, *not* their understanding of how to code. By the time they asked for help and we had realised what was going on it was too late: they were so far behind that they never felt able to catch up. We'd *rather* that you asked and we said "Try it again" than you didn't ask and checked out thinking that you couldn't 'do' programming.

### *How* to Ask for Help

I liked the "How to ask programming questions" page provided [by ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/nerds/how-to-ask-programming-questions):

1. Do some research first.
2. Be specific.
3. Repeat.
4. Document and share.

If you find yourself wanting to ask on Stack Exchange then they also [have a guide](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask), and there are [plenty](https://codingkilledthecat.wordpress.com/2012/06/26/how-to-ask-for-programming-help/) of other [checklists](https://medium.com/better-programming/the-smarter-way-of-asking-for-programming-help-52cd140dc437).

## Learn from Your Mistakes

![](/Users/jreades/Documents/git/i2p/lectures/img/Learning_from_Mistakes.png)

## One More Thing...

This year (in particular) we are ***all*** learning new ways to do things. You will get things wrong. I will get things wrong. We will assume that you are trying your best. Please assume the same about us!

It's going to be messy, but I'm *really* excited about it!

### How to 'Ace' the Assessments?

Study like it's a new language.

### Study Aids

- [Google](https://www.google.co.uk) 
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python)
- [Slack](https://www.slack.com)

^ Google will become more useful as you learn more and this is definitely one class in which "I Googled it" is a *good* answer.

^ As of early September, Stack Overflow contains over 1.5 *million* Python questions alone! Chances are someone else has had your question before.

^ We'll talk about Slack more [later](./1,4-Tools_of_the_Trade.md)

## What Are We Trying to Do?

This class hopes to achieve three things:

1. To teach you the basics of how to *code* in Python.
2. To teach you the basics of how to *think* in Python (or any other language).
3. To show you how the concepts *taught* in GIS and Quantitative Methods can be *applied* to a practical (spatial) data analysis problem.

---

### Also...

We hope to convince you that you *can* code. 

Learning to code does *not* require mathematical ability.

Learning to code does *not* require linguistic ability.

Learning to code *does* require practice. And more practice. And more again.

---

If you only code during the practical session then you will *not* learn how to code. 

If you cram the night before then you will *not* learn how to code.

If you do 60 minutes every other night, then you *will* learn how to code.

## Computers in Planning & Geography

All of this may seem very new and very scary if you have a 'traditional' background in Planning or Geography. But...

### Wave 1

“A computer in every institution”:

- Roughly the 1950s–70s

- Computers as **‘super-human’ calculators** for data

- Data + models as theory-testing tool

Retrospectively: the ‘first quantitative revolution’.

^ Many see this as incorrect and focus on the theoretical aspect.

---

### Wave 2

“A computer in every office”:

- Roughly the 1980s–2000s

- Computers as tools for **thinking about spatial relationships**

- Explicit modelling of local spatial effects

Retrospectively: the ‘GIS revolution’.

^ I also see this as incorrect because GIS is Wave 1.

---

### Wave 3

“A computer in every thing”:

- Roughly the mid-2000s–?

- Computers as tools for **generating data** (*pace* ABM researchers)

- Geodata being continuously produced as byproduct of other activities

- Shift from researching attributes to behaviours (*pace* Hägerstrand)

Retrospectively: the ‘big data revolution’ or 
 ‘2nd quantitative revolution’.

^ Shift from computers as processors of data **to integrated, pervasive systems** that spew out data on *everything*.

---

### All Waves Still Going!

**Wave 1: Computers help me do it** **faster**

- GIS is ‘just’ the industrial revolution impacting cartography.

**Wave 2: Computers help me to** **think**

- Geocomputation & local stats are qualitatively & meaningfully different.

**Wave 3: Computers… help me to *learn***

- Not ‘just’ about the ‘bigness’ of data, though that is important.

^ Wave 2 is about implementing ideas such as recursion and iteration – these could, in theory, have been tackled in Wave 1, but in practice that’s not what people were doing.

^ Wave 3 is about more explicitly allowing computers to learn about data so that we can extract insight from these models – these could also, in theory, have been tackled in Wave 2 but in practice that’s not what people were doing.

^ I’m not totally happy about my description of Wave 3 and will try to dig into this in a little more detail but suggests welcome!

### Anticipated by Hägerstrand (1967), Natch

“I think that the computer can do three different and useful things for us. The first and simplest operation is straightforward **descriptive mapping**… the second and more important function is the **analytical one**… The third kind of service is perhaps the most interesting and promising. This service is to run **process models** by which we might try to reproduce observed or create hypothetical chains of events of a geographical nature.” (italics in original)

*T.* *Hägerstrand* (1967), ‘The Computer and the Geographer’, *TiBG*

### But Persistent Critiques

There is a clear disparity between the sophisticated theoretical and methodological framework which we are using and our ability to say anything really meaningful about events as they unfold around us. There are too many anomalies between what we purport to explain and manipulate and what actually happens. There is an ecological problem, an urban problem, an international trade problem, and yet we seem incapable of saying anything of any depth or profundity about any of them. When we do say something it appears trite and rather ludicrous.

*Harvey (1972, p.6)*

## Data Science to the Rescue?

Data… *science*?

- Industry-led

- Spatially ignorant (often)

- Disciplinarily greedy (often)

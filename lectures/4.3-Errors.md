> We all make mistakes, it's how we deal with them that matters. It's the same in Python: understanding and handling errors is the key to good code.

## Helpfully...

Python will always try to tell you what it **thinks** when wrong: "I didn't understand what you meant by this..." or "I'm sorry, I can't let you do that Dave..."

The challenges are:
1. Python tends to give you a *lot* of information about the error: this can be very helpful for programmers dealing with complex problems and **totally overwhelming** for beginners.
2. That what Python thinks the problem is doesn't always line up with where the problem *actually* is. In cases of syntax, for instance, the problem *could* be an unclosed parenthesis **three lines earlier**!

---
### Challenge 1
That the 'error' isn't always the error...
```
total = 0
print("About to start loop"
for i in range(1,10):
  total += i
print(total)
```
This outputs:
```
print("About to start loop"
... for i in range(1,10):
  File "<stdin>", line 2
    for i in range(1,10):
                        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>>   total += i
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    total += i
    ^
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

---
### Challenge 2

> See Challenge 1.

```
print("About to start loop"
... for i in range(1,10):
  File "<stdin>", line 2
    for i in range(1,10):
                        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>>   total += i
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    total += i
    ^
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

## Errors Have Types

> In the same way that variables have types, so do errors. These types give us insight into the issue, but they also allow us to distinguish between different types of errors.

![](mi_question_answer)  Why might the ability to distinguish between different types of errors be helpful?

---
### Trapping Errors

We might reasonably want to distinguish between errors that we could reasonably **expect** or that are **not serious**, from those that **we did not expect** or that **call the results of the program into question**.

^ So it makes sense to think: "Well, let's **try** this and see what happens. If we have a problem of *this* type then it's not serious and we should carry on. But if we have a problem *that* type then we need to stop what we're doing right away."

---
## Python's Approach

Python calls errors **exceptions**, so this leads to:
```python
try:
  ... some code that might fail...
except <Named Error Type>:
  ... what do it if it fails for a specific reason...
except:
  ... what to do if it fails for any other reason...
finally:
  ... always do this, even if it fails...
```
We can even *create* our own problems:
```
raise Exception("Sorry, I can't let you do that, Dave.")
```

---
### For Example

If `x=10` and `y=0` then: 
```
print(x/y)
> Traceback (most recent call last):
>   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
> ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

But if you 'trap' the error using `except` then: 
```
try:
  print(x/y)
except ZeroDivisionError:
  print("You can't divide by zero!")
except:
  print("Something has gone wrong.")
finally: 
  print("Division is fun!")

> You can't divide by zero!
> Division is fun!
```

*Note:* if we need to access the *actual* exception: `except ZeroDivisionError as e:`

---
### I'm Just Creating Problems Now

You can trigger your *own* exceptions using `raise`.

```
try:
  print(x/y)
except ZeroDivisionError:
  print("You can't divide by zero!")
  raise Exception("Please don't do that again!")
finally: 
  print("Division is fun!")
```
---

### Errors & More Errors!

If `x=10` and `y=0` then the previous slide's code produces:

```
You can't divide by zero!
Division is fun!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 5, in <module>
Exception: Please don't do that again!
```

---

### Understanding Multiple Errors

1. The code we `try` triggers the `ZeroDivisionError` block.
2. This prints `"You can't divide by zero!"` 
3. We `raise` a new exception that is *not* caught.
4. The `finally` code executes because it *always* does.
5. Python exits with a message from our raised Exception.

Thus: 'During handling of above (ZeroDivisionError) another exception (our Exception) occurred...'

---

### Typed Errors

We can create our own classes of error very easily:

```
class CustomError(Exception):
  pass
```

This can then be triggered with:

```python
raise CustomError("Our custom error")
```

And (very importantly) this can be caught with:

```python
except CustomError: 
  ... do something ...
```

But you can go a lot further than this... exceptions could accept customised arguments, perform tidying-up or rollback operations, etc.

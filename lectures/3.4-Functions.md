# Writing Functional Code
---
## Let's Get Lazy!

Why do any work you don't **need** to?

Functions allow us to ![](mi_sync)  code!

Bonus: they can make our code more **legible**.

---
### A Working Definition

> Functions 'encapsulate' a task (they combine many instructions into a single line of code). Most programming languages provide many built-in functions that would otherwise require many steps to accomplish, for example computing the square root of a number. In general, **we don't care how a function does what it does**, **only that it 'does it'**! 

---
### What Does a Function Look Like?

> `len(my_list)` is a function.

So `len(...)` encapsulates the process of figuring out how long something with 'countable units' actually is, whether it’s a string or a list.

---
### Even This Can Be Tricky!

`len(123)` is a Type Error.

`len(‘123’)` is not. 

![](mi_question_answer)  Can you think why?

---
### So What Does a Function Look like?

All function 'calls' looking something like this:
```
function_name(...)
```
Where the '`...`' are the inputs to the function; it could be one variable, 25 variables, a list, even another function! 

And if the function 'returns' something it will look like this:
```
return_data = function_name(...)
```

### As Code 
```
data = [1,25,-4,14,7,9]
total = 0.0
count = len(data)
for i in data:
  total += i
mean = total/count
```

+++
### As Function
```
def calc_mean(numbers):
  total = 0.0
  count = len(numbers)
  for i in numbers:
    total += i
  return total/count

data = [1,25,-4,14,7,9]
mean = calc_mean(data)
```

---
### Simple Function

By 'simple' I don't mean *easy*, I mean it does *one* thing only:
```
def hello():
  print("Hello world!")
```
We then run it with:
```
hello()
```
And that produces:
```
Hello world!
```

---
### Passing in Information

We can pass information _to_ a function if we tell the function what to expect:
```
def hello(name: str):
  print("Hello " + name + "!")
```
Now we can do this:
```
hello("new programmers")
> Hello new programmers!
```

---
### Getting Information Out 

Functions become more useful when we can also get information *out* of them!
```
def hello(name: str) -> str:
  return "Hello " + name + "!"
```
Now the function does this:
```
output = hello("new programmers")
print(output)
> Hello new programmers!
```

---
### Writing a Function

```
def <function name>(<var. name>: <var. type>) -> <return var. type>:
  <details of function>
  ...
  return <var. of return var. type>
```
This can also be written:
```
def <function name>(<var. name>):
	...
	return <var>
```
Python is 'friendly' in the sense that all of the `<variable type>` information is optional, but it will help you (and Python) to know what you were **expecting** to happen.

### Data
```
ds2 = {
  'lat':[51.51,40.71,35.69],
  'lon':[0.13,74.01,139.68],
  'tz':[+0,-5,+8],
  'name':['London','New York','Tokyo']
}
```

+++
### Code
```
def get_city_info(data: dict, city: str, field: str):
  return data[field][ data['name'].index(city) ]

print("The latitude of New York is " + get_city_info(ds2, 'New York', 'lat'))
```

---
### Just *One* Little Problem
There's just *one* little problem... **does that code work?** *Hint:* it's to do with the return value...

![Quick Quiz](mi_question_answer)  How do we fix this?

Using functions requires us to think through both **inputs** and **outputs**: 

- What kind of data might go into the function?
- What kind of data might come out of the function?

---
### Fixing that Problem

In this case, we have two choices:
1. Convert everything to a string *before* returning the output: `return str(...)`, which would make our function definition look like this: `def get_city_info(...) -> str:`
2. Or return whatever we find and force the 'user' to convert whatever comes *out* of the function before using it: `def get_city_info(...) -> Any:`

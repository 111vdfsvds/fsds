# Python: the Basics

### It's *always* about variables...

### Naming Variables

Other rules for variable names:

- They cannot start with a number (e.g. `3items` is invalid)

- White space and symbols (e.g. `$`, `+`, etc) are **not** allowed, but `_` (underscore) *is* allowed (e.g. `my_variable` is fine)

- Case matters: `myVar` is different from both `myvar` and `MYVAR`

- Be consistent: `my_var` is more 'Pythonic', though `myVar` is also widely used, but don't mix these!

- Variable names should be long enough to be clear but not so long as to be impractical: `bldg_height` vs. `bh` vs. `max_building_height_at_eaves`.

### Names to Avoid

You should not try to use *any* of these words as a variable. Python may not complain, but strange things will happen.

|          |         |        |        |       |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| and      | del     | from   | not    | while |
| as       | elif    | global | or     | with  |
| assert   | else    | if     | pass   | yield |
| break    | except  | import | print  |       |
| class    | exec    | in     | raise  |       |
| continue | finally | is     | return |       |
| def      | for     | lambda | try    |       |

### Variables Have Types

| Name    | Value                        | Type                                                         |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| msg     | 'Hello world'                | `type(msg)==str`                                             |
| answer  | 42                           | `type(answer)==int`                                          |
| pi      | 3.14159                      | `type(pi)==float`                                            |
| correct | True                         | `type(correct)==bool`                                        |
| print   | `builtin_function_or_method` | [It's complicated...](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12347647/python-test-whether-object-is-a-builtin-function) |

As well see next week, everything is *also* an object.

### Syntax (A Well-Formed Command)

The most common sources of syntax errors are:

1. Incorrect Indenting;
2. Missing colons on conditional code;
3. Unbalanced parentheses.

---

### All of Them Together!

```python
if hours > 0:
print("Hours were worked.")
else
	print "No hours were worked.")
```

---

### That's Better!

```python
if hours > 0:
  print("Hours were worked.")
else:
	print("No hours were worked.")
```

---

### Syntax Errors (A Poorly-Formed Command)

Output from the Python interpreter:

```python
>>> if hours > 0:
...     print("Hours were worked.")
... else
  File "<stdin>", line 3
    else
       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>>     print "No hours were worked.")
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print "No hours were worked.")
    ^
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

### Make Your Life Easy (Easier)

Always comment your code:

1. So that you know *what* is going on.
2. So that you know *why* it is going on.
3. So that others can *read your code*.
4. To help you *plan* your code

^ You are reminding your future self what your code was *for* and helping to give it structure (explaining==thinking!).

---

```python
# This is a comment
print("Foo")
print("Bar") # Also a comment
# You can have multiple comments
# like this before code. And even
# keep code from running
# print("Baz")
```

---

```python
#  Function for processing occupational data
def occ_data(df):
    #  Columns of interest in data set
    occ = ['Managerial','Professional','Technical',
           'Administrative','Skilled','Personal Service',
           'Customer Service','Operators','Elementary']
    
    # Integrate results into single dataset -- 
    # right now we don't replicate Jordan's approach of
    # grouping them into 'knowledge worker' and 'other'. 
    occ_data = pd.DataFrame()
    ...
```

---

These are not really comments, but can help when you have a really long comment to make:

```python
"""
So I was thinking that what we need here is 
a way to handle the case where the data is
incomplete or contains an observation that we
weren't expecting (e.g. "N/A" instead of "0").
"""
```

### Commenting Tips

- Include general information at the top of your code

- Assume the person reading the code is a coder themselves

- Good commenting is sparse in the sense that it is precise and concise without being overly verbose

- Conditional execution: comments useful to track flow

- Loops: logic can be difficult to understand later

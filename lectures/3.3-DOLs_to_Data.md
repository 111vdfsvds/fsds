## Another Look
```
my_cities = {
  'London': [[51.5072, 0.1275], +0], 
  'New York': [[40.7127, 74.0059], -5], 
  'Tokyo': [[35.6833, 139.6833], +8]
}
```
So:
```
print(my_cities['London'][0])
> [51.5072, 0.1275]
```

### Implications

> So we can mix and match dictionaries and lists in whatever way we need to store... 'data'. The question is then: what's the **right** way to store our data?

 **Answer**: the way that makes the most **sense** to a human while *also* being the most **robust** for coding.
 
^ So in the example we just saw I'd say that the `my_cities` dictionary-of-lists doesn't really make a lot of sense to a human. We need to somehow remember that element 0 of the New York list is a lat/long pair!

## Another Way...

```
my_cities = [
  {name: 'London', loc: [51.5072, 0.1275], tz: +0}, 
  {name: 'New York', loc: [40.7127, 74.0059], tz: -5}, 
  {name: 'Tokyo', loc: [35.6833, 139.6833], tz: +8}
]
```

![Quick Quiz](mi_question_answer)  Why *might* this list-of-dictionaries be a **better** way to store this data about cities than the dictionary-of-lists?

### And Again...
  ```
my_cities = {
  {name: 'London', loc: [51.5072, 0.1275], tz: +0}, 
  {name: 'New York', loc: [40.7127, 74.0059], tz: -5}, 
  {name: 'Tokyo', loc: [35.6833, 139.6833], tz: +8}
}
```

![Quick Quiz](mi_question_answer)  Why *might* this dictionary-of-dictionaries (with lists as well!) be an **even better** way to store this data about cities?

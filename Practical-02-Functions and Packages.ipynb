    "\n",
    "I also want you to understand how to approach the kind problem I've just set: turning a text file into data and performing some analysis.\n",

    "_**Note**_: you might also find it helpful to take a close look at the URL that we are reading by pasting this link into a web browser: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kingsgeocomp/geocomputation/master/CitiesWithWikipediaData-simple.csv. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyse the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to writing a program is thinking about your goal and the steps required to achieve that. We _**don't**_ write programs like we write essays: all at once by writing a whole lot of code and then hoping for the best when we hit 'submit'. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you're tackling a programming problem you break it down into separate, simpler steps, and then tick them off one by one. Doing this gets easier as you become more familiar with programming, but it remains crucial and, in many cases, good programmers in large companies spend more time on _design_ than they do on actual _coding_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some steps in a program are done so many times by so many people that, eventually, someone writes a _package_ that bundles up those operations into something easy to use that saves _you_ having to figure out the gory details. Reading a file (even one on a computer halfway round the world) is one of those things. Analysing a data file for you is probably not.\n",

    "\n",
    "To a computer, reading data from a remote location (e.g. a web site halfway around the world) is not really any different from reading one that's sitting on your desktop: to simplify things a great deal it really just needs to know the location of the file and an appropriate _protocol_ for accessing that file (_e.g._ http, https, ftp, local...) and then a clever programming language like Python will typically have packages that can kind of take of the rest. \n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases -- local and remote -- you use the package to handle the hard bit of knowing how to actually 'read' data (because all files are just `1`s and `0`s of data) at the _device_ level and then Python gives you back a 'file handle' that helps you to achieve things like 'read a line' or 'close an open file'. You can think of a filehandle as something that gives you a 'grip' on a file-like object no matter where or what it is, and the package is the way that this magic is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q.How is a package different from a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. A package is just a bundle of useful functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's a little more to it than this (as we'll see later in the term), but simplest way to think of this is that when we type `import foo` then we are including functions from the `foo` package in our code. You'll see how this works below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of the bundle-of-functions is that they can help us to achieve quite a lot very quickly since we don't need to reinvent the wheel and can just make use of someone else's code. In the same way that we won't mark you down for Googling the answer to a coding question, we won't mark you down for using someone else's package to help you get going with your programming. _**That's the whole point!**_\n",

    "\n",
    "I've said before that the way a computer 'thinks' and the way that we think doesn't always line up naturally. Experienced programmers can think their way _around_ a problem by working _with_ the computer, rather than against it. Let's apply this approach to the parsing of CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's an _Appropriate_ Data Structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you saw when I asked you to calculate the mean population of British cities twice -- once using the simple file, and once using the bigger, more complex file -- there is a 'problem': our list-of-lists isn't very easy to navigate. Not only _might_ the location of the Population column be different in the two files (as it was, deliberately), but when we want to work out the mean we need to step through a lot of irrelevant data as well (in our for loop we need to skip past the name, latitude, longitude, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "And if I asked you to find the _largest_ city you'd need to do even more work. That doesn't make much sense since this should all be easier and faster in code than in Excel, but right now it's _harder_ and _slower_! When you get into situations like this (having to write a lot of code to do something that should be fast and easy) it is often the case that you've got the wrong _data structure_. \n",
    "\n",
    "So how does the experienced programmer get around this? 'Simple': she realises that the data is organised the wrong way! We humans naturally tend to think in rows of data: London has the following _attributes_ (population, location, etc.), and York has a different set of attributes. Se we read across the row because that's the easiest way for us to read it. But, in short, a list-of-lists does _not_ seem to be the right way to store this data!\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, a computer doesn't have to work that way. For a computer, it's as easy to read _down_ a column as it is to read _across_ a row. In fact, it's easier, because each column has a consistent _type_ of data: one column contains names (strings), another column contains populations (integers), and other columns contain other types of data (floats, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "Better still, the order of the columns often doesn't matter as long as we know what they are called: it's easier to ask for the 'population column' than it is to ask for the 6th column since, for all we know, the population column might be in a different place for different files but they are all (relatively) likely to use the 'population' label for the column itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Dictionary of Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we don't care about column order, only row order, then a dictionary of lists would be a nice way to handle things. And why should we care about column order? With our two CSV files above we already saw what a pain it was to fix things when the layout of the columns changed from one data set to the next. If, instead, we can just reference 'population' column then it doesn't matter where that column actually is. Why is that? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, here are the first four rows of data from the simple city file as a list-of-lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "['id', 'Name', 'Rank', 'Longitude', 'Latitude', 'Population'], \n",
    "['1', 'Greater London', '1', '-18162.92767', '6711153.709', '9787426'], \n",
    "['2', 'Greater Manchester', '2', '-251761.802', '7073067.458', '2553379'], \n",
    "['3', 'West Midlands', '3', '-210635.2396', '6878950.083', '2440986']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, here's how it would look as a dictionary of lists organised by _column_, not by row:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myData = {\n",
    "    'id'         : [1, 2, 3],\n",
    "    'Name'       : ['London', 'Manchester', 'West Midlands'],\n",
    "    'Rank'       : [1, 2, 3],\n",
    "    'Longitude'  : [-18162.92767, -251761.802, -210635.2396],\n",
    "    'Latitude'   : [6711153.709, 7073067.458, 6878950.083],\n",
    "    'Population' : [9787426, 2553379, 2440986],\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this do better? Well, for starters, we know that everything in the 'Name' column will be a string, and that everything in the 'Longitude' column is a float, while the 'Population' column contains integers. So that's made life easier already. But let's test this out and see how it works."

    "myData['Population'][0]\n",
    "```\n",

It finds out that the value associated with this key is a _list_ (`[9787426, 2553379, 2440986]`). In this example, it just pulls out the first value (index 0), which is `9787426`. Does that make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to the second part:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myData['Name'].index('Manchester')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very similar: we look in the dictionary for the key `Name` and find that that's _also_ a list (`['London','Manchester','West Midlands']`, since you asked). If you don't remember what `index` does, don't worry, here's the output from Python's `help()` function:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Help on built-in function index:\n",

    "So all we're doing is asking Python to find out the index of 'Manchester' in the list associated with the dictionary key 'Name' _instead_ of just sticking in a `0` to get the first index value. Putting these two things back together what we're doing is:\n",

    "Notice the complete _absence_ of a for loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Does that make sense? If it does then you should be having a kind of an Alice-through-the-Looking-Glass moment because what we've done by taking a column view, rather than a row view is to make Python's ``index()`` command do the work for us. Instead of having to look through each row for a field that matches 'Name' and then check to see if it's 'Manchester', we've pointed Python at the right column immediately and asked it to find the match (which it can do very quickly). Once we have a match then we _also_ have the row number to go and do the lookup in the 'Population' column because the index _is_ the row number!\n",

    "\n",
    "Where this approach really comes into its own is on problems that involve maths. To figure out the easternmost city in this list we need to find the _maximum_ Longitude and then use _that_ value to look up the city name. So let's do the same process of pulling this apart into two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be _pretty_ obvious what this does:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myData['Name'][0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But we don't just want the first city in the list, we want the one with the highest longitude. So to achieve that we need to replace the `0` with an index that we found by looking in the `Longitude` list.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myData['Longitude'].index(max(myData['Longitude']))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ugh, that's still a little hard to read, isn't it? Let's write it down another way to make it easier to read:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myData['Longitude'].index(\n",
    "    max(myData['Longitude'])\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There's the same `.index` which tells us that Python is going to look for something in the list associated with the `Longitude` key. All we've done is change what's _inside_ that index function to `max(myData['Longitude'])`. This is telling Python to find the _maximum_ value in the `myData['Longitude']` list. So to explain this in three steps, what we're doing is:\n",
    "* Finding the maximum value in the Longitude column (we know there must be one, but we don't know what it is!),\n",
    "* Finding the index (position) of that maximum value in the Longitude column (now that we know what the value is!),\n",
    "* Using that index to read a value out of the Name column.\n",
    "\n",
    "I _am_ a geek, but that's pretty cool, right? In one line of code we managed to quickly find out where the data we needed was even though it involved three discrete steps. Remember how much work it was to find the mean when you were still thinking in _rows_, not _columns_?\n",

    "Here we're going to 'cheat' a little bit: rather than writing our own function, we're going to import a package and use someone _else's_ function. The `numpy` package contains a _lot_ of useful functions that we can call on (if you don't believe me, add \"`dir(np)`\" on a new line after the `import` statement), and one of them calculates the average of a list or array of data.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np # Need to import a useful package\n",
    "mean = np.mean(myData['Population'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is where our new approach really comes into its own: because all of the population data is in one place (a.k.a. a _series_ or column), we can just throw the whole list into the `np.mean` function rather than having to use all of those convoluted loops and counters. Simples, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Review!\n",
    "\n",
    "So the _really_ clever bit in all of this isn't switching from a list-of-lists to a dictionary-of-lists, it's recognising that the latter is a _better_ way to work _with_ the data that we're trying to analyse and that that there are useful functions that we can exploit to do the heavy lifting for us. Simply be changing the way that we stored the data in a 'data structure' (i.e. complex arrangement of lists, dictionaries, and variables) we were able to do away with lots of for loops and counters and conditions, and reduce many difficult operations to something that could be done on one line!

    "If all of this has made sense to you then the _final_ step in this practical should be easy... Nah, I'm just kidding: there is a _lot_ to make sense of in this practical and you shouldn't worry if it hasn't all become clear to you just yet. But what I _can_ say is that you should read, and re-read this, until it _does_ make sense. Talk to your classmates. Talk to your teachers. This is the practical that unlocks everything that comes after: how to write code that can be re-used, how to make use of code written by other people, and a little bit about how to _think like a computer_. \n",
    "\n",
    "The _best_ way to be sure that you've understood the concepts here is to write a standalone Python script that takes any URL, parses it as a CSV file, and returns a dictionary-of-lists on which you can perform simple numerical analyses like the ones we just did above. You shouldn't need to write much in the way of new code because what you need to do involves _remixing_ the code that we've just been working with! The _only_ thing that will really require some thought is how to change the `readRemoteCSV` function from return a list-of-lists to a dictionary-of-lists. That won't be easy, but it shouldn't be impossible either. Remember that you can always start by breaking the problem down into little steps: how do you turn the header row into dictionary keys? how do you keep track of which column is associated with which key?\n",
